If you’re worried about what you’ve missed, we recommend reading archives from our mailing list ( ocf.io/announce ). These will usually contain links to presentations slides and information about what was covered. You can also ask a veteran staffer to bring you up to speed. What if I can’t physically be present at weekly meetings? You can still be part of OCF staff! Even if you can't make meetings, the suggestions on this page are useful for getting started.

Staying in touch by being active in Slack/Discord/Matrix/IRC and email are great ways to be part of the OCF community. Edit this Page Page History Table of Contents How can I get involved in the OCF?
