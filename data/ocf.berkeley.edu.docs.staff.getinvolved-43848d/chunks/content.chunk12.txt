Some important channels: #rebuild - technical discussion #administrivia - non-technical discussion #ocf for off-topic, non-OCF related discussion These channels are typically very active, and you shouldn’t feel the need to read every line to stay updated. You also aren’t required to understand all the technical jargon that’s used in #rebuild.

Feel free to introduce yourself in any of these channels if you’re new, and don’t be afraid to ask questions! Hang out in the lab OCF staff members usually like to socialize in the lab. We’re a friendly bunch, so feel free to talk to us!

You can also come into the lab after-hours—just say you’re interested in joining staff and we’ll let you in. FAQ I wasn’t able to make the first/second/nth meeting of the semester, can I still join? Yes! You can join at any time.
