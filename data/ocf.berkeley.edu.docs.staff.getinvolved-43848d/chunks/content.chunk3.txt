If you are interested in gaining insight into the internal operations the OCF from an administrative perspective, please come to BoD meetings! Meetings always are open to all. Staff Meeting Wednesday 8-9pm In these meetings, all OCF staff (that includes you!) get together to discuss technology, learn from each other, and work on OCF projects. These meetings will be a mix of presentations, work time, and socializing. Our goal is to build OCF staff into a strong community of capable individuals.

Starter Tasks There are no prerequisites to joining staff, other than a willingness to learn and participate! If you have no prior experience with coding, Linux, working with servers, etc.

and would like to learn how to contribute to the OCF technically, we have a variety of starter tasks, beginner projects, and other resources to help you get acquainted.

The most effective way to get started is to come to the lab during weekly meetings and after-hours to talk to staff members!
