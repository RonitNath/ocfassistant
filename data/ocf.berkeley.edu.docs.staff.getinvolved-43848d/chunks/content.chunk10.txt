Help requests During the semester, our help@ocf.berkeley.edu mailing list gets around 14 emails per week from the UC Berkeley community. Volunteers like you respond to these emails. Most requests are about requesting virtual hosting and helping users debug or fix their websites.

If you’re interested in seeing how this process works, ask a staffer to add you to the RT mailing list.

Since this is high-volume, we recommend filtering these to a different folder so you don’t get notified all the time. Joining this list doesn’t obligate you to respond to help requests. It’s perfectly acceptable to only read tickets as a way to learn more about what we do. If you’re on staff, you can view the ticket archive at rt.ocf.berkeley.edu .

Your idea here As a volunteer organization, the OCF’s direction is driven by the interests of our members. If you have a new idea for the OCF, we want to help you build it.
