OCF staff members hold regular drop-in staff hours to provide assistance with account issues or with OCF services. We're always happy to help troubleshoot account or service issues!

Keep in mind the OCF volunteers sometimes have last-minute conflicts, so it's a good idea to check this page for cancellations. Staff hours are now in person! Visit ocf.io/lab for directions. If you need online staff hours, please email help@ocf.berkeley.edu .
