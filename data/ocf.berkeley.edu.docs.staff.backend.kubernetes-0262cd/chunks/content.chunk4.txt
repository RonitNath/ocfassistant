Do note that the state stored in etcd is scheduling state, service locations, and other cluster metadata; it does not keep state for the services running on the cluster. Why the odd number of masters? Consider a cluster of N members. When masters form quorum to agree on cluster state, quorum must have at least ⌊ N /2⌋+1 members. Every new odd number in a cluster with M > 1 masters adds one more node of fault tolerance. Therefore, adding an extra node to an odd numbered cluster gives us nothing. If interested read more here . Workers Workers are the brawn in the Kubernetes cluster.

While master nodes are constantly sharing data, managing the control plane (routing inside the Kubernetes cluster), and scheduling services, workers primarily run pods .

kubelet is the service that executes pods as dictated by the control plane, performs health checks, and recovers from pod failures should they occur.
