It is considered best practice to run an odd number of masters , and currently our cluster has three masters.

Masters Kubernetes masters share state via etcd , a distributed key-value store (KVS) implementing the Raft protocol. The three main goals of Raft are: Leader elections in case of failure. Log replication across all masters. Ensuring log integrity across all masters. One master is elected as a leader of the cluster. The leader has the ability to commit writes to the KVS.

etcd then reliably replicates this state across every master, so that if the leader fails, another master can be elected and no state will be lost in the process.
