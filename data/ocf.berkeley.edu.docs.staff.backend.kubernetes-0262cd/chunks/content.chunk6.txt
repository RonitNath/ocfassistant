While pods are essential for understanding Kubernetes, when writing services we don't actually deal in pods but one further abstraction, deployments , which create pods for us.

OCF Kubernetes Cluster Bootstrapping Since almost all OCF architecture is bootstapped using Puppet, it was necessary for us to do the same with Kubernetes. We rely on the puppetlabs-kubernetes module to handle initial bootstrapping and bolt OCF specific configurations on top of it.

puppetlabs-kubernetes performs two crucial tasks: Installs etcd , kubelet , kube-proxy , and kube-dns , initializes the cluster, and applies a networking backend. Generates the required PKI for Kubernetes and etcd . Do note that puppetlabs-kubernetes is still very much a work in progress. If you notice an issue in the module you are encouraged to write a patch and send it upstream.

Kubernetes PKI All the private keys and certs for the PKI are in the puppet private share, in /opt/puppet/shares/private/kubernetes .
