Rather, it is meant to explain architectural considerations such that current work can be built upon.

Although, reading this document will help you both deploy services in the OCF Kubernetes cluster and debug issues when they arise. Kubernetes Kubernetes is a container orchestration system open sourced by Google.

Its main purpose is to schedule services to run on a cluster of computers while abstracting away the existence of the cluster from the services. The design of Kubernetes is loosely based on Google's internal orchestration system Borg.

Kubernetes is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation , which is a part of the Linux Foundation.

Kubernetes can flexibly handle replication, impose resource limits, and recover quickly from failures. Kubernetes Cluster A Kubernetes cluster consists of "master" nodes and "worker" nodes. In short, master nodes share state to manage the cluster and schedule jobs to run on workers.
