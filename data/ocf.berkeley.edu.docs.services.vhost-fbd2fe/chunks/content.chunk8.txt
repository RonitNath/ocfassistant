Relevant domain name : Registered Student Organizations may only use domains or request subdomains that are the officially recognized name of the group or a recognizable shortened version of the official name.

Exceptions to this rule must be approved by the LEAD Center prior to requesting the domain from the OCF.

In general, the subdomain must reasonably and uniquely identify the student group that is requesting it, and not be easily confused with another group or University department or resource.

Hosting badge All virtual hosts on the OCF must include an OCF banner on the front page that links to the OCF home page . The banner must be noticeable without undue effort.

The hosting badge not only attributes the OCF but also distinguishes it from sites hosted by University departments.
