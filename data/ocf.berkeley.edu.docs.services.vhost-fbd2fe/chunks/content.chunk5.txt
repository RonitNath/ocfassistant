Policies Groups, faculty, and academic staff only The OCF only performs virtual hosting for OCF group accounts and individual accounts belonging to UC Berkeley faculty, and the faculty and academic staff of associated institutions which are listed in our eligibility policy .

Each account may have at most one virtual host, but you are free to set up external domains which redirect to it.

Faculty and academic staff are not eligible for mail hosting for their individual accounts, as mail hosting is intended for mailing lists or group accounts.

Furthermore, virtual hosts for faculty and staff will only be approved if they have already obtained a domain name from their department or elsewhere. Group accounts for research groups are not subject to these restrictions.

While we are happy to host personal websites for faculty and staff, we will not manage their DNS, nor provide mailing lists for individual accounts.
