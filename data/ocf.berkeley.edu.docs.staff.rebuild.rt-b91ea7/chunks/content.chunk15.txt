Create a template with the name "Correspondence Creation" and description "For mailing staff on ticket creation, but without all that boilerplate". Keep type as "Perl".

Paste this in as the content: RT-Attach-Message: yes Subject: {$Ticket->Subject} {$Transaction->Content()} Save changes.

Modify the scrip "On Create Notify AdminCcs" to use the template "Global Template: Correspondence Creation". Send spoofed mail. Mail in the past has come from actual people, not endless drones of "via RT". Let's fake that for people who are uncomfortable with change.

At the top of Correspondence, Admin Correspondence, Admin Comment, and Correspondence Creation templates, append the following below the last mail header that appears, if any exist: From: { my $u = $Transaction->CreatorObj; my $a = $u->EmailAddress; my $res = $u->RealName || $u->Name; $res .= " <".$a . ">" ; $res; } Automatically close tickets.
