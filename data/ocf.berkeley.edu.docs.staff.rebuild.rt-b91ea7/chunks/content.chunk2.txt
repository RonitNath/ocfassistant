Install required packages: sudo aptitude install mysql-server sudo aptitude install -t squeeze-backports request-tracker4 rt4-db-mysql For Apache 2: Install sudo install libapache-mod-auth-kerb sudo install -t squeeze-backports rt4-apache For Nginx: Install sudo install -t squeeze-backports nginx rt4-fcgi and enable the RT FastCGI daemon: in /etc/default/rt4-fcgi , edit: enabled=1 Debian packages an obscenely old version of Nginx in stable, so please don't install that.
