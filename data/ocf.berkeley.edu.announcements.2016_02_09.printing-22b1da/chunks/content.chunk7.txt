The reason for the immediate implementation is that it helps to avoid a rush to print in the coming days before a semesterly quota reset. We know printing changes are inconvenient.

It's unfortunate that we have to make these changes, and we hope that in future semesters we can find the resources to raise quotas again.

In addition the the OCF lab, we'd also like to remind you that there are other places to print on campus, such as the libraries, the ResComp-run labs in the dorms, and your program's computer labs (e.g. Dwinelle Language Lab, Athlete's Printing Room, Soda Hall).

In the mean time, we hope you'll continue to use the OCF lab in its entirety; the convenient location, open space, and comfy furniture make it a great place to work between classes or late at night. Our volunteer student staff are always open to hearing your thoughts.

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact us , or come to one of our weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 7:10pm in the lab.
