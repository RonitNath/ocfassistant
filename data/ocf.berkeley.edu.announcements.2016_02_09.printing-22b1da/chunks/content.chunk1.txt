Here are the details about how and why.

February 9, 2016 Last semester, we moved from our trusty old space in 6A Hearst Gym into our shiny new home in 171 MLK, more than twice the size and conveniently located in the ASUC Student Union.

The new lab is great: it's larger, more accessible, and has allowed us to serve many more users than in previous semesters, especially with the lab being open later. However, coupled with the lab being open later, we've seen huge jumps in overall lab traffic.
