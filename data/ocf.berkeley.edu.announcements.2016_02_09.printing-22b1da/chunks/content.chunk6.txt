These users have a disproportionate impact on our printing costs, so we're decreasing the semesterly quota to help limit that expense. The decrease to 100 pages per semester will affect only about 20% of our users.

Of course, we know that many people pace their printing throughout the semester, and we want to ensure we're being fair. As such, we're not taking into account the number of pages you've already printed this semester * .

This means that you'll still have a full quota of 100 pages to work with for the rest of the semester, starting today. Daily quota changes will take effect on Tuesday. Semesterly quotas have already been changed. Starting on Tuesday, February 16th, the new daily quotas will be enforced.

The grace period is intended to avoid penalizing people who had already planned to print large jobs in the next few days. The semesterly quota change has already taken effect. We feel this is fair, as we're not affecting anyone's short-term plans.
