The number of students using the lab each day has greatly increased since 2014, with an especially large jump after the move to MLK (last semester, around November 16, 2015).

Since 2013, we've gone from printing about 10,000 pages per week, up to almost 40,000 pages per week this semester.

We're running the printers at more than four times the manufacturer's recommended maximum pages per month.

We don't have much of a choice; we have to limit the pages printed per day, or we risk breaking our printers beyond repair.

Historically, we've implemented a number of measures to manage our levels of printing, including draft-quality printing, lower-quality paper, and third-party toner.

However, the OCF has never faced such a massive increase in number of users, lab usage, and printing before.

Long-term members of the OCF will remember that the weekday printing limit was 10 pages per day in 2014.
