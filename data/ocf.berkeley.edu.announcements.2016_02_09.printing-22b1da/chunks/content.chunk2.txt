We're breaking records for the number of people in the lab and the number of pages being printed nearly every day. Even with the increased capacity, we're filling the lab nearly every day. We want the lab to be a great place to work.

The lab is our most important asset, and we want it to be a great place for students to work, study, and collaborate.

It doesn't serve its purpose when there's a 15-person long line to sit at a computer because people are waiting on printers.

Our vision for the lab is for it to be a collaborative space, not just the campus free printing hub. Printing is an important service, and we're not ending it.

But we're expecting to spend over $13,000 on printing alone this year even after making the changes outlined here, and we just don't have the money to continue printing at the current level. Lab usage from a busy day this semester. There are 27 computers in the lab.
