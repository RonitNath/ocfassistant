Our budget and lab usage levels back then allowed us to increase the limit to the limit announced at the beginning of the school year, but we have to reverse this decision. We're continuing the tradition of allowing double the number of pages on weekends.

While we understand this is less convenient, we hope this will help strike a balance between the needs of our members and the physical limits of our printers. The semesterly quota is decreasing to 100 pages per semester.

We spent a lot of effort trying to find ways to cut costs while affecting the least number of people. The semesterly quota turns out to be one of the best places we can make that happen.

The average user prints only 61 pages per semester, while a very small number of users (about 7%) actually come close to exceeding their semesterly quota (printing more than 200 pages).
