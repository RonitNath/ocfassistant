            <h3>
                We're changing our printing policies to match
                our new lab space.
                <br/>
                Here are the details about how and why.
            </h3>
            <p><em>February 9, 2016</em></p>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Last semester, we moved from our trusty old space in 6A Hearst
                Gym into our shiny new home in 171 MLK, more than twice the
                size and conveniently located in the ASUC Student Union.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new lab is great: it's larger, more accessible, and has
                allowed us to serve many more users than in previous semesters,
                especially with the lab being open later.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, coupled with the lab being open later, we've seen huge
                jumps in overall lab traffic. We're breaking records for the
                number of people in the lab and the number of pages being
                printed nearly every day. Even with the increased capacity,
                we're filling the lab nearly every day.
            </p>

            <p><strong>We want the lab to be a great place to work.</strong></p>

            <p>
                The lab is our most important asset, and we want it to be a
                great place for students to work, study, and collaborate. It
                doesn't serve its purpose when there's a 15-person long line to
                sit at a computer because people are waiting on printers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our vision for the lab is for it to be a collaborative space,
                not just the campus free printing hub. Printing is an important
                service, and we're not ending it. But we're expecting to spend
                over $13,000 on printing alone this year even after making the
                changes outlined here, and we just don't have the money to
                continue printing at the current level.
            </p>

                    Lab usage from a busy day this semester. There are 27 computers in the lab.
                </small>
            </p>
            <hr />

            <p>
                We've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how best to meet
                our budget while impacting the fewest people. Below we'll
                describe the changes we're making and our rationale for them.
            </p>

            <p><strong>The daily quota is decreasing to 8 on weekdays, and 16 on weekends.</strong></p>
            <p>
                So far this semester, we've had an average of about 750 users
                in the lab each day. That's a huge jump from last semester,
                where the average was closer to 500.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, our resources haven't kept up with the increased
                demand. When you subtract out moving expenses, such as
                purchasing another 15 computers, monitors, and peripherals, our
                budget this year is less than it was last year in a space half
                the size.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only are we facing budget troubles, but our printers are
                starting to fail. They've both now printed
                <a href="/stats/printing/pages-printed">over a million pages</a>.
                They're several years old and starting to show it. The
                near-doubling of printing this semester has greatly increased
                the frequency of paper jams and other technical glitches (just
                ask the front desk staff).
            </p>

            <hr />
            <p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://static.ocf.berkeley.edu/img/announcements/unique-lab.svg" /></p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <small>
                    The number of students using the lab each day has greatly
                    increased since 2014, with an especially large jump after
                    the move to MLK (last semester, around November 16, 2015).
                </small>

            <p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://static.ocf.berkeley.edu/img/announcements/printing-per-week.svg" /></p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <small>
                    Since 2013, we've gone from printing about 10,000 pages per
                    week, up to almost 40,000 pages per week this semester.
                </small>
            </p>
            <hr />

            <p>
                We're running the printers at more than four times the
                manufacturer's recommended maximum pages per month.  We don't
                have much of a choice; we have to limit the pages printed per
                day, or we risk breaking our printers beyond repair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, we've implemented a number of measures to manage
                our levels of printing, including draft-quality printing,
                lower-quality paper, and third-party toner. However, the OCF
                has never faced such a massive increase in number of users, lab
                usage, and printing before. Long-term members of the OCF will
                remember that the weekday printing limit was 10 pages per day
                in 2014. Our budget and lab usage levels back then allowed us
                to increase the limit to the limit announced at the beginning
                of the school year, but we have to reverse this decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're continuing the tradition of allowing double the number of
                pages on weekends. While we understand this is less convenient,
                we hope this will help strike a balance between the needs of
                our members and the physical limits of our printers.
            </p>

            <p><strong>The semesterly quota is decreasing to 100 pages per semester.</strong></p>
            <p>
                We spent a lot of effort trying to find ways to cut costs while
                affecting the least number of people. The semesterly quota
                turns out to be one of the best places we can make that happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The average user prints only 61 pages per semester, while a
                very small number of users (about 7%) actually come close to
                exceeding their semesterly quota (printing more than 200
                pages). These users have a disproportionate impact on our
                printing costs, so we're decreasing the semesterly quota to
                help limit that expense.
            </p>

            <hr />
            <p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://static.ocf.berkeley.edu/img/announcements/semester-histogram.svg" /></p>
            <p class="text-center">
                <small>
                    The decrease to 100 pages per semester will affect only about
                    20% of our users.
                </small>
            </p>
            <hr />

            <p>
                Of course, we know that many people pace their printing
                throughout the semester, and we want to ensure we're being
                fair. As such, we're not taking into account the number of
                pages you've already printed this semester<a href="#exception-printed-150">*</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that you'll still have a full quota of 100 pages to
                work with for the rest of the semester, starting today.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Daily quota changes will take effect on Tuesday. Semesterly quotas have already been changed.</strong></p>
            <p>
                Starting on Tuesday, February 16th, the new daily quotas will
                be enforced. The grace period is intended to avoid penalizing
                people who had already planned to print large jobs in the next
                few days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The semesterly quota change has already taken effect. We feel
                this is fair, as we're not affecting anyone's short-term plans.
                The reason for the immediate implementation is that it helps to
                avoid a rush to print in the coming days before a semesterly
                quota reset.
            </p>

            <p><strong>We know printing changes are inconvenient.</strong></p>
            <p>
                It's unfortunate that we have to make these changes, and we
                hope that in future semesters we can find the resources to
                raise quotas again.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition the the OCF lab, we'd also like to remind you that
                there are other places to print on campus, such as the
                libraries, the ResComp-run labs in the dorms, and your
                program's computer labs (e.g. Dwinelle Language Lab, Athlete's
                Printing Room, Soda Hall).
            </p>
            <p>
                In the mean time, we hope you'll continue to use the OCF lab in
                its entirety; the convenient location, open space, and comfy
                furniture make it a great place to work between classes or late
                at night.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our volunteer student staff are always open to hearing your
                thoughts. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to
                <a href="/docs/contact/">contact us</a>, or come to
                one of our weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 7:10pm in the lab.
