If you’re trying to run a webapp or other kind of server process on the SSH login server ( ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu ), please note that the SSH login server is firewalled and what you’re trying to do unfortunately won’t work. If you’re a group and you’re trying to run a webapp, you may want to consider apphosting instead.
