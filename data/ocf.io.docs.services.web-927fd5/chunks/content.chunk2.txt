Uploading Files Upload files to your web space the same way you upload files to your OCF account (typically SFTP if used remotely). The only difference is that files for your web space are placed in your public_html directory. Additional details The web server runs Apache 2.4 with FastCGI (mod_fcgid) and suEXEC. Access and error logs are accessible in /opt/httpd using SSH . The web server itself runs as a dedicated user.

If your .htaccess file is not world-readable (e.g., chmod 644 ), the web server will return the error "401 Forbidden". PHP/CGI/FastCGI scripts are executed as your user, so they do not need to be world-readable.

If they contain sensitive information (such as database passwords), you should make them private (e.g., chmod 600 or chmod 700 ). Both individual hosting and student group hosting are done entirely over HTTPS.
