We do not currently use many of the managed features of the switches, mostly using them to provide layer 2 connectivity.

Our previous switch, a Cisco Catalyst 2960S, was used for some time to drop Spanning-tree protocol BPDUs and IPv6 Router Advertisements on all ports, as they caused network configuration problems on our end (creating loops with IST, or hosts autoconfiguring themselves via SLAAC). The one advanced feature that we do use on our primary switch is LACP. All of our hypervisors use Solarflare SFN8522-R2 dual-port 10GbE SFP+ NICs.

Both ports are plugged into the switch, with each hypervisor occupying a vertical pair of switch ports.

Each vertical pair is configured into a channel-group and port-channel, numbered according to the index of the pair, e.g. ports Ethernet 31 and Ethernet 32 are aggregated into port-channel 16. The hypervisors are then configured to bond the two interfaces in LACP mode.
