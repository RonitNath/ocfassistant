These devices were donated to us by Arista Networks in Fall 2018.

Each device in the lab connects first to the back of a patch panel, and then from a port on the patch panel to a port on one of the 7048T-As via Cat6.

The servers connect directly to the 7050SX via SFP+ DACs, as does our uplink to IST, through a Cat6 to 1GbE SFP+ converter. The 7048T's connect to the 7050SX through their SFP+ uplink ports.
