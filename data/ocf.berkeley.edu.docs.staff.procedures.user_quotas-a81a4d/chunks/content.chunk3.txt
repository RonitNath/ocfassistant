You can disable the quota entirely by setting 0 for both the soft and hard limit, but this is not recommended because the next time somebody tries to raise disk quotas, it will "raise" your quota from "no quota" to the new quota. To mimic an infinite quota, just give the account a very large quota instead. Raising disk quotas for every user Are you trying to raise disk quotas for every user? Congratulations on finding this page!

The SM who wrote this section spent a couple of hours trying to figure out how in the hell our automatic disk quotas were working, despite all internet documentation claiming there is no way to set default disk quotas. Indeed, you cannot configure a default quota. You can, however, set quotas for non-existent users! We've set quotas for user IDs 1000 through 99999 in order to mimic default users.
