Anyone who logged into their OCF account during the transition had their credentials migrated, but alumni who didn't log in may be missing a Kerberos principal . For them, it is necessary to manually add one.

This error manifests itself as the following when a user attempts to reset their password: kadmin Error: kadmin: cpw <username>: Principal does not exist To add the principal, run the following: $ kadmin add --use-defaults --random-password <username> You will need an admin principal yourself to do this. kadmin will return the password and you can relay this to the alumni.

Disabled Account If the account is sorried , refer to the documentation for unsorry to re-enable the account.

Manual Verification of Alumni Identity Before re-enabling access to an alumni's account, one should verify their identity.

If they do not have a CalNet UID or are otherwise lacking a reasonable method of verifying their identity, it may be necessary to request manual verification of identity.
