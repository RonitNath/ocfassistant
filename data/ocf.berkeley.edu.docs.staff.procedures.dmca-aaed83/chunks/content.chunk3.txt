The service provider restores the allegedly infringing material (to avoid liability to the subscriber) if it has not received a timely notice from the complaining party that injunctive relief has been sought. (More details on each step are in the document.)

For other takedown or cease and desist notices like trademark claims, you should provide similar notification to our users, but consult with the University.

In general, for all takedown or cease and desist notices (DMCA or otherwise): If the request originates from outside the University, consult with the LEAD Center and/or the DMCA designated agent (IT Policy). For DMCA notices, the designated agent should be telling us what to do.

If the request originates from within the University, for example a professor, also consult with our Faculty Advisor and/or the ASUC.
