If a DMCA takedown notice is received, refer to Guidelines for Compliance with the Online Service Provider Provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , a 6-page document by the University, which describes the procedure that we should follow: "Notice" is sent to the service provider by the complaining party.

The service provider notifies the subscriber and removes or disables the allegedly infringing material.

The service provider provides a copy to the complaining party of a timely counter-notice from the subscriber and notifies it that the removed or disabled material will be restored in no less than 10 business days and no more than 14 business days unless the entity notifies the provider that it has sought a court order for injunctive relief.
