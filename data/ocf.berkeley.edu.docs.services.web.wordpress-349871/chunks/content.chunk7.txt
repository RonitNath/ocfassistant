I forgot my MySQL (database) password The database password used by WordPress is recorded in the WordPress configuration file wp-config.php on the line that looks like define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here'); If you ever need your password back, you can always find where WordPress is installed (usually ~/public_html or ~/public_html/wordpress ) and open wp-config.php in an editor or get the password over SSH like so: cat ~/path/to/wordpress/wp-config.php | grep DB_PASSWORD My site URL is configured incorrectly If your site URL is configured incorrectly, you may have issues such as being unable to log in or being caught in a redirect loop.

If that's the case, you can fix it by: Go to our web-based SSH client and sign in with your username and password.
