Change directory to your WordPress installation (probably ~/public_html , unless you changed it): cd ~/public_html Run the following commands, substituting the correct URL for example.berkeley.edu : $ wp option update home 'https://example.berkeley.edu' $ wp option update siteurl 'https://example.berkeley.edu' You may also need to run a full search and replace on all URLs on the site: $ wp search-replace 'www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~example' 'example.berkeley.edu' If you've just received virtual hosting and you're changing your site URL from https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yourgroup to https://yourgroup.studentorg.berkeley.edu , you may additionally need to edit the .htaccess file in the root of your WordPress installation. Specifically, you should replace /~yourgroup/ with / whenever it occurs in that file.
