Migrating from WordPress.com to OCF If you already have a site hosted at WordPress.com and you'd like to move it to OCF web hosting, for example, to become eligible for virtual hosting , you can move most of your website's functionality and content to the OCF's servers. Generally, the process is simple and sites migrated from WordPress.com hosting to the OCF function quite well, apart from possible minor differences in the appearance of themes.
