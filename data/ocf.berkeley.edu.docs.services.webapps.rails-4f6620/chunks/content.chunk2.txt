Setting up RVM Create a directory for your app to live in: mkdir -p ~/myapp cd ~/myapp Install RVM in your home directory.

Note that rvm is terrible and will modify your shell config files without asking, but that's probably what you want, since it will make using and managing Ruby/Rails easier.

Go find the RVM commands appropriate for your app, and copy the lines straight into your shell to install it. In general this is a bad way to install things, but it only has to be done once.

At the time of writing, it looks like this: gpg2 --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys D39DC0E3 curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable Go ahead and run it, and source rvm : . ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm Install whatever version of Ruby you want. (Newer is better).
