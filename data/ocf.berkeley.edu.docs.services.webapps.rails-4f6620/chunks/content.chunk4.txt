~/.rvm/scripts/rvm cd ~/myapp/src RAILS_ENV=production \ exec ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.0/bin/unicorn_rails \ -l /srv/apps/$(whoami)/$(whoami).sock Replace ~/myapp/src with the path to your app (make sure the path is correct for the version of Ruby you are using), then make run executable: chmod +x ~/myapp/run Test executing the run script. You should be able to access your website while running it (or see any errors in your terminal). Some things to keep in mind: You may need to migrate your database first. Make sure you've set secret keys for the app and any gems that need them (e.g. devise).

Static file serving is off by default in production, but you'll want to turn it on: set both config.assets.compile and config.serve_static_assets (rails 4.1), config.serve_static_files (rails 4.2), or config.public_file_server.enabled (rails 5) to true in config/environments/production.rb .
