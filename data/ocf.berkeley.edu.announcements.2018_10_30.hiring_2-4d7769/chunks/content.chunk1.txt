October 30, 2018 We are looking to hire students to be OCF Operations staff for the 2019 academic year and onward!

This includes two paid positions, Operations Assistant and Operations Manager, neither of which require any technical experience.

These are very important roles, and without dedicated and passionate students to fill them, the OCF will not be able to stay open next semester.
