However, if you are adding someone to root staff, in addition to modifying LDAP, you will also have to create their /root and /admin principals (if those don't already exist).

For example, to create the /admin principal, you would do: $ kadmin kadmin> add otherstaffer/admin you/admin@OCF.BERKELEY.EDU's Password: Max ticket life [1 day]: Max renewable life [1 week]: Principal expiration time [never]: Password expiration time [never]: Attributes []: Policy [default]: otherstaffer/admin@OCF.BERKELEY.EDU's Password: Verify password - otherstaffer/admin@OCF.BERKELEY.EDU's Password: At the very first prompt, you are prompted for your password. It's safe to accept the defaults for the next few prompts.

The last two prompts should be filled in by the new root staffer; it will become the password for their /root or /admin principal.

After you've created these principals, you'll need to grant them powers in the Kerberos ACL file in Puppet .
