This assumes the path for the LVM-backed disk is in /dev/vg/<vm> but it may be in a different directory within /dev depending on the volume group name: $ export VM=<vm name here> $ sudo lvresize -L +<size in GiB>G /dev/vg/$VM Get the new size in bytes for the disk (25 GiB here for instance): $ sudo fdisk -l /dev/vg/$VM | head -n 1 Disk /dev/vm/<vm>: 25 GiB, 26843545600 bytes, 52428800 sectors Resize the block device in virsh using the previous size in bytes: $ sudo virsh blockresize $VM /dev/vg/$VM <size in bytes>B On the VM (KVM guest) The new disk size should have been detected by the kernel toward the bottom of dmesg output: $ sudo dmesg | less [...] virtio_blk virtio1: [vda] new size: 52428800 512-byte logical blocks (26.9 GB/25.0 GiB) vda: detected capacity change from 21474836480 to 26843545600 Get some information about the disk (current partition sizes, types, current disk size) before proceeding further.
