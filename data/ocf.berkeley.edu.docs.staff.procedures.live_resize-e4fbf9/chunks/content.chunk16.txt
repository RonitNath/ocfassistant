You're mostly looking to make sure that the start of the main partition is the same as before, that it's larger than before, and that no data except a swap partition had its start moved: (parted) p Model: Virtio Block Device (virtblk) Disk /dev/vda: 54525952s Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B Partition Table: msdos Disk Flags: Number Start End Size Type File system Flags 1 2048s 52428799s 52426752s primary lba 2 52428800s 54525951s 2097152s primary linux-swap(v1) lba (parted) unit GiB (parted) p Model: Virtio Block Device (virtblk) Disk /dev/vda: 26.0GiB Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B Partition Table: msdos Disk Flags: Number Start End Size Type File system Flags 1 0.00GiB 25.0GiB 25.0GiB primary lba 2 25.0GiB 26.0GiB 1.00GiB primary linux-swap(v1) lba If you're using GPT, the first primary partition should have the bios_grub flag set. The file systems shown shouldn't really matter here. Quit parted .
