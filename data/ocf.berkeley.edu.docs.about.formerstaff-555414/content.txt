On the Berkeley Campus Elsewhere Other groups On the Berkeley Campus Elsewhere Where have OCF staffers gone after leaving the OCF? Many OCF staffers have found the skills and experience they gained from being OCF staff have been useful after leaving us. While we obviously can't claim credit for everyone or being the sole source of experience for people, we'd like to think everyone who has donated time to help us has gained something in return, whether it be skills, experience, new friends, or just the satisfaction of making a difference helping your fellow students. Some of the places OCF staffers have gone on to work at: On the Berkeley Campus Berkeley Multimedia Research Center Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Astrophysics EECS Department Technical & Computing Services (TCS) Campus Information Systems & Technology (IS&T) Haas School of Business InfoPad Research Group, Electrical Engineering Lawrence Berkeley National Lab Letters & Science Computer Resources Molecular & Cell Biology Residential Computing Services, Housing and Dining (now called Student Technology Services ) School of Information Management and Systems School of Law Statistical Computing Facility Elsewhere Adobe The Aerospace Corporation Amazon Americorps Anderson Consulting Apple Applemon Arista Arthur Andersen & Co.
