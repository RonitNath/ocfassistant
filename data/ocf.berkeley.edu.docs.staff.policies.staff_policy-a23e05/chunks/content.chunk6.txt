Abuse of root privileges may result in consequences including, but not limited to, loss of root and/or staff privileges, being banned from the OCF, and/or being referred to the Office of Student Conduct. Amending of certain policies There are some policies (e.g. this policy, the Unattended Processes Policy, …) that the Site Managers have the power to amend.

The SMs’ power to amend these policies is not delegated to the Deputy Site Managers or any other staffer.

In other words, staffers cannot unilaterally make changes to these policies without the SMs’ (or GMs’ or BoD’s) approval. Site Managers should promptly inform staffers whenever they make amendments to any such policies.
