[per OCF Board decision on 4/13/89] [The rest of this policy is per Site Manager decision on 8/30/17] Background The OCF Decision Making Process spells out the powers of BoD, the GMs, and the SMs; however, it doesn’t explain what powers other staffers have.

The main purpose of this policy is to delineate what things staff can do on their own, what things they must not do, and what things they require special permission from the SM to do.
