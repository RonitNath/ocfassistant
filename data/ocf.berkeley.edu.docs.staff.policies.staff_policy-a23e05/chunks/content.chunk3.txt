You must have been a staffer for at least a semester already (although this requirement can be waived at the discretion of an SM). You must demonstrate a concrete, actual need for root privileges (e.g. a command you need to run which is blocking your OCF work). The Site Managers can revoke Technical Manager status. This can happen, for example, if root privileges arenâ€™t actively being used. If you are a Technical Manager, use your additional powers wisely. Remember that you must respect the privacy of other members.
