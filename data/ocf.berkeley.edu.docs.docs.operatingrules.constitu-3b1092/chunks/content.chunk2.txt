The intent of this organization is to provide an environment where no member of Berkeley's campus community is denied the computer resources they seek.

This group's spirit can be traced directly to the former Undergraduate Computing Facility; however, this organization's membership is much more widely open.

It is also the intent of this group to appeal to all members of the Berkeley campus community with unsatisfied computing needs and to provide a place for those interested in computing to fully explore that interest.

It is the intention of this group that any OCF-sponsored computing facility always be controlled and maintained by an open and inclusive group of students.
