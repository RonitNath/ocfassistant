In contrast, staffers without keycard access may only be in the lab when there is someone with keycard access in the lab as well. More specifically, no staffer without keycard access is permitted within the lab if there is no one with keycard also within the lab as well. As circumstances may result in staffers with keycard having to step out of the lab for short periods of time, a general rule of thumb will be that if those with keycard will return in a 30 minute time frame, non-keycarded staffers are free to stay. OCF staffers are permitted to bring in as many guests after hours as is considered reasonable.

Note that this is not a right, but a privilege and as such can be revoked if SMs/GMs feel that guests are being disruptive.

Any non-staffer in the lab after hours must be logged in the OCF guest sign-in sheet, and failure to do so may be considered abuse of keycard privileges.
