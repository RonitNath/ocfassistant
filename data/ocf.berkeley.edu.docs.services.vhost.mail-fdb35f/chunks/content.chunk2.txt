By contrast, mail virtual hosting lets you create as many email addresses as you'd like @mygroup.studentorg.berkeley.edu . These addresses can be used both to receive mail (via mail forwarding), and send mail. The details of how to use these addresses are below. Getting set up with mail virtual hosting By default, groups only have regular web virtual hosting.

If you'd like to get started using mail virtual hosting, send us an email at hostmaster@ocf.berkeley.edu letting us know you'd like to enable email virtual hosting. Be sure to include both the domain name, and your OCF account name.

Once your domain is configured for mail, head over to our mail virtual hosting page to add and remove addresses.

How sending and receiving mail works The OCF does not provide "true" mail hosting -- we do not store mail on our servers, nor do we provide a new mailbox for you to monitor.
