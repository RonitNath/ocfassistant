There are too many email clients for us to provide instructions for, so here are the settings you'll need: SMTP server: smtp.ocf.berkeley.edu Port: 587 Security: TLS, verify cert Username: The full email address, including domain name Password: The password you set Note that we only provide email sending , so you only need to configure SMTP and not POP/IMAP. Good luck! What if I only want to receive and not send email? You can totally do that! Just set up an address to forward to and don't bother configuring the sending address. You can even leave the password blank.
