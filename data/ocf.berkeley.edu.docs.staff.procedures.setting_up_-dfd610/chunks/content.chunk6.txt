Reboot and launch the Debian installer. Make sure not to do the "OCF Automated Install" at PXE, do an "expert install" instead. sorry. When you get to partitioning, use common sense.

I recommend switching to another TTY ( Ctrl+Alt+F2 ) and using fdisk to create ~40GB root, ~8GB swap, and the rest as one partition (for LVM). These should be created on the RAID device (typically /dev/md0 if you only have one RAID array).
