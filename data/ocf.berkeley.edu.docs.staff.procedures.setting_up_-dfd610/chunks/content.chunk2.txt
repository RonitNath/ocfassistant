Also, MegaCLI isn't very consistent between versions, and in general it's extremely buggy and poorly-written. So you might have to modify the instructions slightly to get something that works. Aside: why software RAID instead of MegaRAID? Because the software that comes with LSI's RAID controllers is terrible. It's called MegaCLI and you will never read anything good about it.

Examples of problems we've had in the past with MegaCLI: Random commands just don't work on some versions (but do work on others). Out of the ~5 versions we tried, all segfaulted on at least one of our physical servers, so we had to mantain two different versions of MegaCLI. It's ridiculously hard to use and lacking in documentation. The CLI design is junk. What does "RAID Level: Primary-1, Secondary-0, RAID Lvl Qualifier-0" mean without Googling it?
