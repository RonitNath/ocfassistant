Before recording an account request for a group with approve , check to see if the group already has an account. Be sure to use different forms and abbreviations of the group's name to maximize the chance that a group will be found. This script will search LDAP for case-insensitive matches in any part of the full name or account name, including part of a word. For example, checkacct wa fel andy will search for any account that has "wa" (as in waf), "fel" (as in Felix), and "andy" (as in Andy) in the full name (LDAP cn) or account name (LDAP uid).
