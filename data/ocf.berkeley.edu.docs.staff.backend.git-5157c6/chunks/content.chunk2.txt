You may commit another staff member's work if you have permission and change the author appropriately (e.g., --author="Guest User <guser@ocf.berkeley.edu>" ).

When committing, git config user.name should be your name and git config user.email should be your OCF email address -- this should be taken care of by LDAP and /etc/mailname on OCF machines. To "update" Get the latest commits from the central repository and update your working tree.

git pull --rebase This will git fetch (update your local copy of the remote repository) and git rebase (rewrite current branch in terms of tracked branch).

The rebase prevents unnecessary merge commits by moving your local commits on top of the latest remote commit ( FETCH_HEAD ).

This is a good thing if you have any local commits which have not yet been pushed to the remote repository.
