If you have "dirty" uncommitted changes, you'll need to commit them or stash them before rebasing ( git stash ). To "upload" Make commits and push them to the central repository.

git add FILES # add current state of FILES in working tree to index git commit # store index as a commit in current branch # repeat git add and git commit for more commits git rebase -i # clean up the history (reword or squash commits) git push # push current branch to tracked branch in remote repository Use git add -p to inspect individual changes before adding each one to the index, and git commit -v to show a diff of your commit when you are prompted for a commit message.

If commits have been made on the remote repository in the meantime, you'll need to "update" first (see above).

To "import" Pull someone else's changes into the central repository, for example from a branch in a staff member's repository ( REMOTE ).
