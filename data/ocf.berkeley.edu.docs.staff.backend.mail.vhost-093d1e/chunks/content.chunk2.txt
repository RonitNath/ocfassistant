It might also be cool if you could change your own password (without having the group password), but that's not currently possible. Technical implementation There is a database on our MySQL host for storing email vhost information.

It has one table, addresses , with columns for the incoming address, password, and forwarding addresses (among others). It has one view, domains , which is generated from the addresses table. This is only used to make the queries Postfix makes simpler.

In particular, you never need to update MySQL to add forwarding to a domain; it's entirely based on ~staff/vhost/vhost-mail.conf . ocflib has simple functions for interacting with this database (see pydoc3 ocflib.vhost.mail ).

We use MySQL lookup tables on the mail host to dynamically look up the list of virtual domains (using the domains view), and the addresses (using the addresses table).
