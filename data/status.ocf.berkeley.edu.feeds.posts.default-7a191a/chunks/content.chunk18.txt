However, our centos-debuginfo mirror is an unofficial one, and is not listed on the CentOS website.&nbsp;</p><p>Our traffic statistics show that the mirror has no to negligible actual usage, with tens to hundreds of megabytes of data transferred daily (almost entirely by bots).&nbsp;</p><p>The project currently occupies 2.7 TiB of disk space, which is the highest of all the projects we mirror, and yet no user is actually using it.

As a result, we will decommission the centos-debuginfo mirror on Saturday, October 30, 2021 at around 1200 PDT.
