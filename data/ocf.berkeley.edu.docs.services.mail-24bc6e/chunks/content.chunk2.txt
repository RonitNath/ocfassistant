Student groups We provide email virtual hosting for student groups who have a virtual host (e.g. mygroup.studentorg.berkeley.edu). See here for instructions on requesting email hosting and configuring email addresses.

Individual accounts Mail service for individual accounts was discontinued over summer 2014, but we are still offering email forwarding for individual accounts indefinitely. Note that sending mail from your individual OCF account is no longer possible.
