This allows us to verify that the people who email us or come in to staff hours are really signatories for their group, and it also gives all the information needed to create group accounts with approve . How it works signat is an interface to the ocflib functions to query the CalLink API for group signatories. ocflib is also used to look up UIDs and OIDs in OCF LDAP and names in the university's LDAP directory service . Usage There are several different types of queries available through signat . $ signat -h usage: signat [-h] {uid,oid,user,name,group} ... Find active student groups and signatories optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit subcommands: {uid,oid,user,name,group} uid Look up the signatory status of a person by CalNet UID oid Look up the signatories of a group by CalLink OID user Look up the signatory status of an OCF user name Look up the signatory status of a person by name group Look up the signatories of a group by group name group and name are the easiest queries to use when a group or signatory doesn't already have an OCF account.
