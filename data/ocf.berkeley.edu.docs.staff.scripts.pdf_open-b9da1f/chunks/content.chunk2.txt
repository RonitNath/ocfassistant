If a user comes asking why their paper isn't printing right, first download the PDF, then run pdf-open $pdf_file .

Don't forget the hyphen, and make sure the filename doesn't have any spaces or weird characters in it. After re-rasterizing the file, Evince will open, and you can start a new print job from there. Monitor the job's progress in printhost.ocf.berkeley.edu to ensure the job survives.

You may refund printing credits to the user in case they've gone over their daily capacity and you're feeling generous.
