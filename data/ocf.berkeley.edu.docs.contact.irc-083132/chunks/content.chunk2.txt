You have a couple of options for chatting: Option 1: Use our web client We have a web client set up at irc.ocf.berkeley.edu using the popular open-source web client The Lounge .

It's already set up with our IRC network settings, so all you need to do is enter a nickname that you want to use and click the connect button at the bottom. You can enter your real name if you want, but it's not required.

Once connected, you can type messages in the bottom bar and press enter and the OCF staff connected will respond to you as soon as we see your messages. Option 2: Using your own client You can connect using any IRC client.

If you do not already have an IRC client, we recommend using Hexchat because it is free, open source, and generally easy to use.
