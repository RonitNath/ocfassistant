Our server settings are listed below: Server: irc.ocf.berkeley.edu Port: 6697 (requires SSL/TLS) Channels: #rebuild (best to reach staff), #ocf (best for off-topic) Option 3: Over SSH If you're logged in to the OCF login server via SSH , you can use the pyrc script to easily connect to IRC.

It will automatically launch a tmux session to contain your IRC session, so that you aren't disconnected when you close the terminal. To do so, just type pyrc and hit enter. irssi will launch; press alt + left/right to switch which channel you're viewing.

Option 4: Over XMPP If you have an XMPP account, you can join IRC channels with room name #channelname and server name irc.ocf.berkeley.edu (alternatively, #channelname@irc.ocf.berkeley.edu depending on your client). An `ocf.berkeley.edu` XMPP account can be used, but an account on any federated server will work.
