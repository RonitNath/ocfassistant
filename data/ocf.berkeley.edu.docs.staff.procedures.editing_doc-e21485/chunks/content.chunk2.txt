from Virtual Hosting : All virtual hosts on the OCF must include an [[OCF banner|doc services/vhost/badges]] on the front page that links to the [[OCF home page|home]]. Editing docs Edits to the documentation are made via the OCF website's Git repository on GitHub. The editing process is like our other Git workflows: Fork the repository on GitHub . Make changes on a new branch. Push your changes. Make a pull request. Once you make a pull request, it will automatically be tested by Jenkins , the build server. Jenkins will also deploy your changes once they have been merged. For simple changes, you can just click "Edit this Page" in the sidebar.

This will open the file in GitHub, and walk you through the steps for either commiting on master or making a pull request.
