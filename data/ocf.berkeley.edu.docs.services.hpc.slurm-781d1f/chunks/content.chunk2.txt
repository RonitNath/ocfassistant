Slurm also intelligently queues jobs from different users to most efficiently use our nodes' resources. Running a job through Slurm Slurm is only accessible while SSHed into hpcctl.ocf.berkeley.edu . Submitting a job to Slurm can be done in one of two ways: through srun , and through sbatch .

When using srun , options are supplied using command-line flags, and the job is attached to the terminal you run srun from.

If there is a queue to run jobs, the terminal will wait until your job starts running, and if the terminal closes, the job will be cancelled.

By contrast, to submit a job using sbatch , you must first create a batch file that includes options for your job, and the commands that your job will run.

The batch file is then submitted, and after the job runs, log files with the job's output to stdout are put into your home directory.
