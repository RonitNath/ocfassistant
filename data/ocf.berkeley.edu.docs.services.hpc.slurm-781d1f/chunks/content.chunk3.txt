When to use srun versus sbatch If your job requires interactivity or inputs from the terminal, or you need a terminal to test or experiment, use srun . Otherwise, use sbatch , as you don't have to keep your terminal open until the job runs.

Alternatively, you could use screen or tmux with srun to keep your job alive, even if you disconnect from your terminal. Resource options Some terminology: Slurm refers to a process as a "task". Even if a single process is using multiple threads/CPUs, it still counts as one task.

By default, without any flags, a job you submit will be allocated one CPU, 100 MB of RAM, and no GPUs, and will run for at maximum 2 days.
