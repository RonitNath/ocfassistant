In order to allocate more resources and time to your job, you must set one or more of these flags: -n / --ntasks : The number of tasks/processes to allocate. Default is 1. -c / --cpus-per-task : The number of CPUs to allocate per task. Default is 1. --mem : The total amount of RAM to allocate. By default, the number supplied is assumed to megabytes. However, the prefixes K , M , G , and T can be appended to the number instead. For example, to allocate 5 gigabytes of ram, use --mem=5G . Default is 100 megabytes. --gres (Optional) : Allocates some GPUs to your job.

The format is --gres=gpu:[optional type]:[number to allocate] . For example, to allocate 2 GPUs of any type, you would include --gres=gpu:2 . To allocate two Nvidia 1080Ti GPUs (our only type right now), you would include --gres=gpu:nv1080:2 . Default is no GPUs.

--t / --time (Optional) : The maximum amount of time your job can take before Slurm forcefully kills it.
