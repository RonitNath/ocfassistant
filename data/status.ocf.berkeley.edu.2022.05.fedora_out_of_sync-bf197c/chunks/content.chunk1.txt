 Open Computing Facility Status: Fedora out of sync Updates for Open Computing Facility services Friday, May 13, 2022 Fedora out of sync I noticed that our Fedora mirror was out of sync due to a slow upstream mirror. Working on it. Update: Switched to another upstream mirror. Sync speeds are higher now.
