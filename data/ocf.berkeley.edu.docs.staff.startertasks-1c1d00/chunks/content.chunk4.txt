Before testing the IRC bot right away, make sure you know how to use it: Using your IRC client (or Slack), join the #test channel. Trigger some bot commands. See https://ircbot.ocf.berkeley.edu/ for a list of commands. For example, saying create: thanks will trigger a response! Find the source code for a particular command to learn how it works. Once youâ€™ve learned about create , you can start making changes to it! Follow the steps in the GitHub README to run the bot in development mode.

Make sure you can talk to the bot in development mode-- it will be named create-yourusername instead of simply create . Make a simple change and test that it works. Bonus: figure out how to get your development bot to join a public channel like #test. (there are multiple ways to do this!)
