You can run git log to check: you should only see one commit at the top that is authored by you, instead of two. Push your new changes as before. If you did the optional step, you will have to add the argument --force-with-lease after push . After pushing, the pull request on GitHub will automatically update with the new changes. Congrats on making your PR! If you want to learn more about what you can do with git, check out our documentation on git .
