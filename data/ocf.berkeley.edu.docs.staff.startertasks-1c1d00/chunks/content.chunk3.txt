Get familiar with the command line All of our servers run Linux, and we interact with them over the command line.

There are a lot of online resources about using the Linux command line, so if you're confused about something, try Googling it!

If you haven't used the command line before, you can go to our command reference page and try running some commands. You can also connect to our ssh server ( ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu ) using your own SSH client.

If you want to get more comfortable, try completing lab 1 from the OCF/XCF Linux System Administration DeCal.
