If you want to work on these but haven't officially been given staff privileges yet, let a current staffer know you’re working on starter tasks and we will add you. These tasks don’t have to be completed in order.

Connect to the OCF IRC network Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a chat protocol invented in the 80s, an early precursor to Slack. The OCF runs an IRC server (since 2002! ), which is bridged to our Slack network.

Many staffers prefer IRC to Slack due to its wide breadth of customizable clients, as opposed to Slack, which requires using their application.

For this task, pick an IRC client, install it on your computer, and use it to connect to the OCF IRC network (details at https://ocf.io/irc ).

Some popular clients are: Irssi (Mac/Linux, console) Weechat (Max/Linux, console) Hexchat (Windows/Linux, graphical) Colloquy (Mac, graphical) See http://www.irchelp.org/clients/ for more recommendations. Once you’ve joined IRC, pick any channel (#rebuild, #henlo, etc) and say hi!
