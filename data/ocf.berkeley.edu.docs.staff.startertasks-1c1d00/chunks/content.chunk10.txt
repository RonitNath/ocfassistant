If you are using a desktop in the OCF lab, you can use the ~/remote folder on the desktop, which is synced to your home directory on supernova. Other editors may have plugins to let you edit files over SSH, such as VS Code . Now that you've made the change, check out the README to see how to run ocfweb in development mode. Once you're running in dev-mode, navigate to the page in your browser and visually check it. Run tests! The instructions for running the tests are also in the README. We didn't make any drastic changes, so the tests should hopefully pass without any issue. If everything looks good, stage your changes using git add , and make a commit using git commit . Push the change to your fork by running git push origin <branch-name> . Return to the GitHub page for your fork. You should see a button to open a pull request for the change you just pushed. Go ahead and open that PR!
