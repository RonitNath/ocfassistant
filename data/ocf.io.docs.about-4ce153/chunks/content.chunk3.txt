To help people explore the field of computing and educate them about the resources available, the OCF also provides a variety of educational services.

We used to co-sponsor a series of Help Sessions, short classes taught throughout the semester on a wide range of computing topics (focusing on resources available to the Berkeley campus community), along with hosting the UNIX SysAdmin DeCal .

Additionally, the OCF used to conduct career fairs in the past with its sister organization, the Computer Science Undergraduate Association .

Now, we host regular Tech Talks that explore new technologies and how they might pertain to elements of the OCF infrastructure.

We also offer e-mail and in-person with our volunteer staff members, as well as online sources of information about computing on the Berkeley campus and how to use the available resources.
