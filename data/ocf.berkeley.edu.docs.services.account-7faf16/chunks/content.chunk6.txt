Disabled accounts Some common reasons accounts are disabled: by request security (e.g., account hijacked) misuse (e.g., excessive use of resources, violation of University policies) Accounts may also be disabled if OCF staff need to contact you but cannot do so. To re-enable your account, you will need to see a Manager during staff hours . If you want to disable your OCF account, please contact us and provide your OCF username.

If your account appears to still be active, we may ask for some evidence that you are the account owner.

Currently, disabled accounts are stored or archived and can be re-enabled by request at a later date. Disabled accounts may eventually be scheduled for deletion.

Backups and Data Retention The OCF maintains onsite and offsite backups of all user data uploaded to our servers.

Our onsite backups of user data consist of 7 days of daily backups, 4 weeks of weekly backups, and 6 months of monthly backups of NFS, MySQL, and PostgreSQL data.
