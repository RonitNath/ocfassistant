Offsite backups are made weekly and consist of the entire state of the onsite backups at the time the backup is made.

Offsite backups are encrypted locally before being uploaded to servers owned by Box.com, under the terms of the University's collaboration agreement with the company.

Offsite backups are retained for a period of 6 months before being deleted for user data privacy reasons. Encrypted backups are only accessible by a small number of OCF staff.
