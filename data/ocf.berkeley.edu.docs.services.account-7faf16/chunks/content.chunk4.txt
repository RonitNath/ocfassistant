Manual verification of identity (typically for alumni with old accounts) If you have forgotten your individual account password and are unable to use CalNet or meet a staff member in person, you may reset your password through our manual verification process. You have two choices: Option 1 (email). Send scanned copies of the documentation to a staff member over email.

For security purposes, please do not mail your documentation to any address listed on this website . This gets archived and mailed out to all staff members.

Instead, please email help@ocf.berkeley.edu and request to start the process (do not include any ID in the initial email). We'll provide a separate email for you to use instead to send in your documentation. Option 2 (postal mail). Mail your documentation to our mailing address . Expect a delay of at least 2-3 weeks, possibly longer over summer.
