The get-keys privilege is used to fetch principals' keys, which is equivalent to knowing the password hash in other authentication systems, so it is not a privilege to be handed out lightly. How does it actually work?

Kerberos is pretty complicated, so explaining exactly how it works gets messy very quickly, but here are the main steps that are taken by Kerberos when a user logs in to their machine. A great guide on these steps is Lynn Root's Explain it like I'm 5: Kerberos , and explains it better and in more depth than the rather cursory overview found here: The user enters their username. Their login is sent to the KDC to receieve a ticket. The KDC checks in its database for a principal that matches the one sent by the client.
