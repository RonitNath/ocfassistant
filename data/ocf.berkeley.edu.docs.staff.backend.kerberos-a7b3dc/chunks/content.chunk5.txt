Principal : A Kerberos principal is essentially a name used to refer to an entry in the Kerberos database. Each principal is associated with a user, host, or service of a realm. All principals shown below are followed by @OCF.BERKELEY.EDU since it is the realm the OCF uses. User : [user] or [user]/[instance] e.g. jvperrin or mattmcal/root . Used for user logins or for user privileges such as editing LDAP or running commands with sudo . Host : host/[hostname] e.g. host/supernova.ocf.berkeley.edu . Used by Kerberos to allow clients to verify they are communicating with the correct host.

For instance, when using SSH to connect to a host, that hosts's principal is looked up to make sure that you are connecting to the right host and that the host is not actually some other malicious host. Service : [service]/[hostname] e.g. ldap/firestorm.ocf.berkeley.edu .
