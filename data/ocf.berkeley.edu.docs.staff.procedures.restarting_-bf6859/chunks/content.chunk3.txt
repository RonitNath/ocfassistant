So you've gotten the necessary permission and made a post on the status blog /updated the MOTD (if it's a scheduled restart). What now? If you are planning to shut down login servers (i.e.

tsunami, vampires and corruption), run the shutdown command on these machines as soon as possible in order to schedule the shutdown and warn users in advance.

You can do this with a command like sudo shutdown -h 22:00 "Rebooting for kernel upgrades" for a shutdown scheduled for 10:00pm. For other VMs, you can shut them each down via sudo virsh shutdown . Be careful to always shut down firestorm last .

This is because once firestorm is shut down, LDAP/Kerberos logins go offline, and the hypervisors can thereafter only be logged into via the root account.

Since you'll not be able to run new commands using sudo, you should always sudo -i before shutting down firestorm.

Once all of the VMs have been shut down, you can then power off the hypervisors via shutdown -h now .
