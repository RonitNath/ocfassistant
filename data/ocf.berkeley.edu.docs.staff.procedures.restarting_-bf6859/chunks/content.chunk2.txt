Whenever a staffer restarts a production service, whether permission is required or not, or restarts a machine that other users have running processes on, they must give notice to other staffers of their actions as soon as possible and ideally receive acknowledgement. The staffer should preferably do this on Slack/Discord/Matrix/IRC.

Staffers scheduling downtime for public-facing services should make a blog post at status.ocf.berkeley.edu to give users sufficient advance notice.

Planned restarts of hypervisors should also be announced on this blog, since restarting hypervisors can often take several minutes or more.

End of policy Rebooting hypervisors Rebooting hypervisors is a slightly risky business. Hypervisors aren't guaranteed to always reboot without problems.

Therefore, you shouldn't reboot them unless you can physically access the lab in case problems arise. Additionally, this risk is the reason (D)SM permission is normally required to reboot hypervisors.
