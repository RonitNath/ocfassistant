In the RT interface, Reply directly communicates with the poster, so look for the last communication with the ticket opener. Comment doesn't directly communicate and is generally for internal discussion.

This can also be done through email, as RT defaults the reply-to field with the queue mailing lists. Be careful here though: to comment through email, send the email to {queue}-comment (i.e. help@ vs help-comment@).

Also make sure that your reply does not include any of the comments, as in make sure the trimmed comment is all the information you want released.
