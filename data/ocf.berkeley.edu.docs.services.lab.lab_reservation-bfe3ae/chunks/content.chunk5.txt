Approving lab usage requests The Board of Directors holds the authority to approve requests to reserve the OCF lab. When the OCF is not formally in session (i.e. during breaks), the Cabinet can make provisional decisions on requests.

If the decisions are ratified at the first Board meeting of the next formal session, they will become valid; otherwise they will expire.

Cancellation and rescheduling The OCF is not responsible for events outside of our control that can interfere with scheduled events. These can include, but are not limited to: fire alarms, building closures, etc.

In situations where events are interrupted, the OCF may be willing to attempt to reschedule the event, but cannot guarantee that an event will be rescheduled.
