In addition, failure to abide by safety procedures (e.g not evacuating during a fire alarm) may result in student groups being banned from reserving the OCF, banning accounts affiliated with the event as well as possible further action as decided by the Board of Directors.

Liability The OCF is not liable for the actions taken by those who attend events within the lab, and will hold the hosting group liable for any policy violations. In addition, the OCF is not liable for any damages during said event. Amendment of this policy The Cabinet may update purely factual information in this policy (e.g. the dates and times of the decal); all other amendments may only be made by the Board of Directors.
