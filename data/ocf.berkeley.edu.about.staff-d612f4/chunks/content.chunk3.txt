Our computer lab, located in 171 MLK Student Union , features high-res scanners, free printing, and high-end desktops with mechanical keyboards and GTX graphics cards, all running Debian GNU/Linux.

Our lab and servers run free and open-source software, such as: Joining the OCF is an awesome way to learn! We love talking tech and learning new things.

We use our weekly board meetings and staff hours not just to make decisions, but also to learn more about *nix and free software. We're totally open and super-inclusive! Our members have a wide range of majors and technical backgrounds. There are tons of ways to learn and have fun! We've got a perfect sandbox to poke around.

In addition to our powerful servers and desktops, staff get access to their own private server to hoze. We meet every Wednesday at 7:10pm in the lab . We hope to see you there!
