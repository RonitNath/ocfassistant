Usage/Example Usage: sorry [user to be sorried] [sorry file] Sorrying a user changes their login shell to the sorryshell, (/opt/share/utils/bin/sorried), copies the sorry file (containing the reason they were sorried) to ~user/.sorry, chmod 000 's the user's httpdir, chmod 500 's the user's homedir, and adds the user to the "sorry" group, before emailing them with the reason they were sorried. If a sorried user attempts to log in, they will be rebuffed.

You will need an admin and root principal (or, atleast, ocfroot membership) in order to run this command, which should preferably be run on supernova in order to find all the appropriate files.

All sorry files are stored in ocf/utils under staff/acct/sorry/ , which is where they should be edited if necessary. Puppet clones this repo to /opt/share/utils/ on all the computers.
