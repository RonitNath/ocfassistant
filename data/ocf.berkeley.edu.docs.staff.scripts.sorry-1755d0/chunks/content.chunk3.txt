After sorrying a user, make sure to run the note command to document the reasoning to ~staff/User_Info. This reason will be read to future users running check on the sorried user. Unsorrying a user is also possible.

If a user is sending too much mail, it may be easier to nomail the user instead of sorrying their account.

This involves adding the user to /etc/postfix/ocf/nomail on anthrax, at which point their ability to send mail will be removed. See how sorry for more information on the sorry command itself.
