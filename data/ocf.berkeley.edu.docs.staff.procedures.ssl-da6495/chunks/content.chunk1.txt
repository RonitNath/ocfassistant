The primary Common Name for a certificate should always be the server hostname , with service CNAMEs specified as Subject Alternative Names.

For instance, a certificate for our apt repository/mirrors should have the primary CN fallingrocks.ocf.berkeley.edu , with apt.ocf.berkeley.edu and mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu as SANs.

This allows us to easily distinguish between certificates in cases where a service may be hosted by multiple hostnames, or where the hostname changes, without sharing private keys.
