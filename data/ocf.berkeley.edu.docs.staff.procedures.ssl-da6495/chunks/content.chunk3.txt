If puppet successfully runs, it should provide these files for whatever service you want to setup that needs SSL: /etc/ssl/private/${fqdn}.key /etc/ssl/private/${fqdn}.crt /etc/ssl/private/${fqdn}.bundle The bundle file is automatically generated from the certificate you provided, and contains the Let's Encrypt intermediate certificate.

You should also make sure to notify the service automatically so that when any new certs come along they are automatically used by the service.

This requires linking the ocf::ssl::default module with whatever service you're using the cert within.

For instance, to restart nginx when certs are updated, add this into your puppet manifest: Class [ 'ocf::ssl::default' ] ~> Class [ 'Nginx::Service' ] Verifying certificates For the host rt.ocf.berkeley.edu on port 443 (HTTPS), try connecting using the OpenSSL client.
