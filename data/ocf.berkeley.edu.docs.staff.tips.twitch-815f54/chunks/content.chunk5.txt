Screencasting in Arch on Wayland GNOME (Note: this uses xdg-desktop-portal, which is currently only stable for GNOME, but is in development for wlroots (sway) https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr and KDE) Install Wayland OBS: aur/obs-studio-wayland Install desktop portal: extra/xdg-desktop-portal, extra/xdg-desktop-portal-gtk Install OBS plugin: aur/obs-xdg-portal-git Start OBS with the environment variable QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland to make sure it runs in Wayland instead of XWayland. In OBS, add the "Desktop Screencast (Wayland/X11)" source to your scene. Note : this setup uses pipewire, which recently upgraded to 0.3. If you're having issues, check to see if the file "/etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.pacnew" exists.
