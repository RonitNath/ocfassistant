We recommend setting up at least two scenes in OBS: one that shows your desktop and one that does not. This way, you can hide your screen if you need to work with passwords or otherwise sensitive stuff. You can switch streams by clicking on the scene on OBS or assigning hotkeys to each scene.

A beginning setup could look like the following: Scene 1 ("Normal") Audio Input Capture (microphones, etc) Audio Output Capture (streams audio from the computer) Screen Capture (screen capture) Video Capture Device (webcams -- optional) Scene 2 ("Desktop Hidden") Picture Text ("Be right back!")

Once you've configured everything properly and connected OBS to Twitch, press "Start Streaming" to begin streaming to Twitch. Streaming Reminders & Recommendations Please record on OBS while streaming! Click both the "Start Streaming" and "Start Recording" buttons. This will allow you to upload the streams to another source like YouTube. Twitch only saves VODs for a short period of time.
