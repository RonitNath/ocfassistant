The master is dementors which runs a cron job every five minutes to collect data from the node server running on each machine. A custom script periodically generates the list of available nodes from LDAP. We monitor servers, desktops, and staff VMs, but not the hozer boxes. Additionally, we don't receive email alerts for staff VMs.
