Automated alerts Munin sends mail to root whenever certain stats run out of bounds for a machine, e.g. if disk usage goes above 92%.

Some plugins have configurable warning and critical levels for each field, which are usually set in the node config like so: [pluginname] env.fieldname_warning min:max env.fieldname_critical min:max The warning bounds for each node are generated from a Puppet template in the ocf module using machine specs from facter.

While config files use underscores, the display name for a variable's warning levels takes the form fieldname.warning or fieldname.critical .

When munin-limits finds a variable in warning or critical range, it pipes the alert text to another script which filters out uninteresting or noisy messages and emails the rest to root.

Munin itself isn't very flexible about disabling alerts from plugins, so, if there is a noisy variable you want to ignore alerts for, you can add it to the list of IGNORED_WARNINGS .
