A better approach is to create a ~/.my.cnf file with proper permissions that contains your MySQL password. To do this, enter the following commands: make sure you replace dbpasswd with the MySQL password given to you when you ran makemysql. touch ~/.my.cnf cat >> ~/.my.cnf << EOF [client] password = dbpasswd EOF chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf And make sure that your .my.cnf has correct permissions by running $ ls -l ~/.my.cnf -rw------- 1 staff ocf 64 2005-11-15 16:16 /home/s/st/staff/.my.cnf Now the mysql command will automatically log you in, so you won't have to memorize or write down your MySQL password.
