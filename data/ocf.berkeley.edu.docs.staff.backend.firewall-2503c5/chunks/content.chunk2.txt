Administering the firewall Accessing the interface Administration of the firewall is done through the web interface , and must be done from an on-campus IP address (for instance through the library VPN or SOCKS proxying through an OCF host).

Remember to specify https when loading the firewall admin page , as it does not have a redirect from http to https.

If you are having connection issues with the firewall admin page loading indefinitely, it is likely because you are trying to use http or trying to access it from an off-campus IP.

To quickly set up a SOCKS proxy, run ssh -D 8000 -N supernova from any off-campus host and then set up the SOCKS proxy (through your OS or through your browser's settings) to use the proxy on localhost and port 8000 .

To sign in to administer the firewall, make sure to use the single sign-on (SSO) option, and it will ask for CalNet authentication.
