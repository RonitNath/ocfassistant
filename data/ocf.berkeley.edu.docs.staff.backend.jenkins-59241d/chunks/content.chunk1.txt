All that means is that when you push code, Jenkins will test that code, Jenkins will build that code (if applicable), and then Jenkins will deploy that code.

Ideally all projects at OCF will go through this pipeline of being tested before deployed, though currently some don't (or some only use some portion, such as deploying without any tests).
