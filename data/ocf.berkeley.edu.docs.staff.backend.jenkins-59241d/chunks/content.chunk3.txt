It is used for running build jobs tagged deploy , whose only purpose is intended to be deploying code which has been built or tested in a previous step. The user has a Kerberos keytab for the ocfdeploy user and our PyPI key in its home directory. Jobs such as upload-deb or puppet-trigger fall under this user.

Within Jenkins, we configure two "slaves" which are really on the same server, but execute by launching the slave.jar file as the jenkins-slave or jenkins-deploy user (via passwordless sudo from the jenkins user, effectively dropping permissions).

The jobs are configured to run on either jenkins-slave (the default) or jenkins-deploy (for deploy jobs).

This is a bit complicated, but it allows us both better security (we no longer have to worry that anybody who can get some code built can become ocfdeploy, which is a privileged user account) and protects Jenkins somewhat against bad jobs that might e.g. delete files or crash processes.
