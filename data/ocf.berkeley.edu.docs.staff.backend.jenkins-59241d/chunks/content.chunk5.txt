From the project page, choose the "Embeddable Build Status" icon, then choose "Markdown (with view), unprotected".

You can optionally change the link to point to the pipeline view rather ther than just the individual job.

Building and tagging pull requests Jenkins can build and tag pull requests with their build status, similar to Travis. To configure this for a repository, create a new job specifically for testing pull requests. For example, puppet-test-pr .

Configure the "GitHub Project" URL to point to the main page of the project (for example, https://github.com/ocf/puppet/ ). Under "Source Code Management", select "Git" and add the repository URL (for example, https://github.com/ocf/puppet/ ). Under "Source Code Management", change "Branch Specifier" to ${sha1} .

Also under "Source Code Management", change "Refspec" (it's under Advanced) to +refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/* .
