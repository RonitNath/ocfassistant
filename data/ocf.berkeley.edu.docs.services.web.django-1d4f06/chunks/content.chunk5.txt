In the same directory, create another file called .htaccess with these contents: RewriteEngine on RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f # Change "user" and "django" to your username and whatever directory # name you made in public_html, respectively. RewriteRule ^(. *)$ /~user/django/run.fcgi/$1 [QSA,L] Your app should now be accessible!

Note that you will likely have to add 'www.ocf.berkeley.edu' to the list of ALLOWED_HOSTS in your application's settings.

Making assets available While your application may load, things like images, stylesheets and javascript might still be failing to load.

Generally, the best way to get these to load is to set the following settings in your application: STATIC_URL = '/~user/app/static/' STATIC_ROOT = '/home/u/us/user/public_html/django/static' Make sure to change user and app in STATIC_URL to the correct paths, same with u/us/user and django in STATIC_ROOT .
