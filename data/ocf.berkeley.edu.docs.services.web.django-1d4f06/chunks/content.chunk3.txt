For example, to create a Python 3 virtualenv, try: user@tsunami:~/app$ virtualenv -p python3 venv user@tsunami:~/app$ venv/bin/pip install django You'll want to install at least django to start with. If you're using other packages, install those too. You can also install from a requirements.txt file, if you have one. For full details on how to use pip, see the pip documentation . Inside that same virtualenv, install the flup6 package.

You can just copy-and-paste the below snippet: user@tsunami:~/app$ venv/bin/pip install flup6 If you're using a requirements.txt file, you might want to add it there as well. This part varies by how you're organizing your project. Make a directory under public_html to house your application. For example, ~/public_html/django . You can also just use public_html directly if desired.
