Then, to generate assets in STATIC_ROOT , run venv/bin/python manage.py collectstatic from the root of your application, and your assets will be copied to the correct location. This should be done after changing your application or adding/removing static assets.

Debugging If you see an error page when trying to load your app, you may find the webserver's logs useful.

You can access them in the following locations: error log: /opt/httpd/error.log (most useful) suexec log: /opt/httpd/suexec.log (only useful in rare cases) Once your app has started running, changes you make to the Python code or templates won't take effect for a few hours. To apply changes immediately, the webserver needs to see that the run.fcgi file has changed.
