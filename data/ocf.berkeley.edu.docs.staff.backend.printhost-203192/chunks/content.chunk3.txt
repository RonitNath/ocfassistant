The application opens up a system print dialog, which gets a list of available printers and options from the local CUPS client, which in turn gets it from the printhost.

The application renders the desired pages to a PostScript, PDF, or other CUPS-compatible format, then sends it to the printhost.

The CUPS server on the printhost receives the job and print options and queues the job for printing.

The actual document, plus metadata including user-set options, is stored in the print spool at /var/spool/cups until a printer becomes available to print it.

The document is converted into a more printer-friendly format before it actually reaches the printer. Once it's ready to print, it is sent to the printer via some backend such as IPP.

Finally, the printer accepts a PostScript document as raw data and prints it out (some also support raster formats).
