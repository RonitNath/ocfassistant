There are two versions of it: one which only allows double-sided printing and one which only allows single-sided. This is how we implement the "double" and "single" classes.

The PPDs tell CUPS to use ocfps to convert documents to PostScript, plus they turn on economode so we can afford the toner.

Print accounting The OCF uses a virtual CUPS printer backend called Tea4CUPS to install a page accounting hook that runs before and after each job is actually sent to the printer. The script is called enforcer , but all the logic is contained in the ocflib printing package .

All jobs are logged in the ocfprinting SQL database, including the username, print queue, and number of pages. Several views count up the number of pages printed by each user per day and per semester.

Page counting is actually done when the document is converted to PostScript, since CUPS-processed PostScript includes the page count as a comment near the top or bottom of the file.
