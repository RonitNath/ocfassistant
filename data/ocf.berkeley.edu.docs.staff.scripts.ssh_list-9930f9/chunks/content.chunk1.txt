The usage of ssh-list looks like: ssh-list <TYPE> [arguments to parallel-ssh] The argument <TYPE> is interpreted by ssh-list , and the arguments after are passed verbatim to parallel-ssh . In most cases, you want at least -i in the arguments to parallel-ssh. -i prints out the stdout and stderr for each host you are running the command on.
