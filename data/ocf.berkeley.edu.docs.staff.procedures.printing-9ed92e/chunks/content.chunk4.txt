In order to replenish stocks of toner, first get in touch with the UC Berkeley PMP Coordinator (as of 2018, this is Pam Krol) to get a quote for a bulk toner order, and then notify our LEAD Center advisor to get the pass-through account chartstring in order to let PMP debit our account directly through the ASUC.

Once a contract is signed, PMP will ship the toner to the lab and withdraw funds from our account automatically.

It is necessary to inform our advisors of this in advance so they can properly authorize and document the fund transfer between the ASUC and the University.

The LEAD center has requested we keep our use of the passthrough account to a miminum, so we've agreed to buy toner in annual intervals.

Recycling used toner OCF goes through toners quite fast, due to the heavy volume of printing from our users.

In the past, we've let it accumulate inside the storage room which resulted in accidental toner spillage.
