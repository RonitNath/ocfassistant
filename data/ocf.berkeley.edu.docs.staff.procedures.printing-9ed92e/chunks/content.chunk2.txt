Instead, they should be removed from the CUPS classes: Go to https://printhost.ocf.berkeley.edu/ (works only in lab) Go to Classes > double > Modify Class Remove the offending printer from the list of selected printers GOTO 2, repeat for the single class Alternatively, this can be done using the utils command mod-printer with proper authentication.

mod-printer remove [printer] The printer is the name of the physical printer (currently: logjam , papercut , or pagefault ). This will prompt you to enter your password twice, once for single and again for double . Note : this command must be used from whiteout .

(In theory pausing printers should have the same effect, but the current CUPS version still queues jobs for them for some unknown reason, causing half of user jobs to not print.)

Restoring printer service Perform the reverse of the above (add the printers back to the classes), then double-check that the printers are not paused.
