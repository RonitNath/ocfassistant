Performing maintenance on the printers Our contract with PMP entitles us to free service for our printers, with a short turn-around time.

As a result, we should not longer attempt maintenance ourselves, and should let the professionals take care of it.

Should maintenance be necessary, email copycenter@library.berkeley.edu (with sm+printers@ cc'd) to contact a PMP technician, inform them of the problem, and let them handle everything else. Make sure to include the relevant printer IDs in the email.

If there are any questions about the terms of our service agreement, direct them to the UC Berkeley PMP Coordinator.
