While it's possible to use Calnet accounts for these (ocf.berkeley.edu emails redirect to Calnet by default), most active staffers choose to have a dedicated account because: It allows for nicer integration with our Google Drive folders It makes it easier to send emails from the ocf.berkeley.edu domain, which is good if you want to send an email while representing the OCF It can be useful to have a separation between OCF and Calnet accounts.
