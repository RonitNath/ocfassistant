expanduser( '~/app' )) from flup.server.fcgi import WSGIServer from myapp.app import app if __name__ == '__main__' : WSGIServer(app) .

run() Make sure to replace the first line of run.fcgi file with the actual path to your project's virtualenv Python. You can find it by running the command readlink -f ~/app/venv/bin/python .

Make sure to also replace ~/app (if you have a different path in your home directory) and from myapp.app with the name of your Flask application that you selected before (we used myapp and app.py but you can use whatever you want).
