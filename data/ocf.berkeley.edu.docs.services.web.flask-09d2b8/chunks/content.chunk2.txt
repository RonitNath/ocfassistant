This will allow you to run pip install to install any python packages that you need that the OCF does not already have.

The benefit of having a virtualenv is that you can decide the dependencies you want, without being tied to the OCF defaults: user@tsunami:~/app$ virtualenv -p python3 venv user@tsunami:~/app$ venv/bin/pip install flask flup6 Feel free to install any other packages you need for your flask app at this step too (or later on, that's cool too).

If you have an existing flask app with a requirements.txt file, then run venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies from that. For full details on how to use pip, see the pip documentation . Create a new python file (or directory) for your application logic.
