After a heated discussion (and short break to get boba), the members of the Board voted unanimously to adopt the new name and acronym.

"I try really hard to stay away from social media like Reddit and Facebook," said Nick Impicciche, the OFC's current General Manager. "Still, we're pretty strong believers in democracy, and it's clear what the people wanted."

After the decision was announced, OCF OFC technicians worked into the night to get the website moved from ocf.berkeley.edu to its new home at ofc.berkeley.edu .

In the coming days, we'll be reaching out to student groups using our web hosting to ask them to replace their now-outdated "Hosted by OCF" web banners.
