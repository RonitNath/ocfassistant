March 31, 2016 Late Thursday night, the Board of Directors of the Open Computing Facility voted to rename the organization to the Open Facility for Computing (OFC).

"After seeing 'OCF' written as 'OFC' by people on Facebook, Twitter, and even by the Daily Cal's writers all in the same day, I decided it was worth bringing up at one of our meetings," said Chris Kuehl, the organization's former Site Manager. (Chris recently stepped down to focus on his studies.)
