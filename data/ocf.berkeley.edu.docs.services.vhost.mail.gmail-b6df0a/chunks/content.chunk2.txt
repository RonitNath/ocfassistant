Set a password for the email. From the same page as before, make sure you've set a secure password for the email address. This is the password you'll use when configuring Gmail to send as your account. From Gmail, go to the settings page and start adding a new address.

From your Gmail account, click on the settings wheel in the top-right corner, then click "See all settings". At the top of the Settings page, click the tab that says "Accounts". From this page, click "Add another email address you own".

Fill out the name and email. In the window that opened, fill out the first section with your name and the full email address. It's important to use the same email as in step 1. After filling this in, click "Next Step". Fill out the SMTP server details.

Use the following settings: SMTP Server: smtp.ocf.berkeley.edu Username: The full email address , including @mygroup.studentorg.berkeley.edu at the end. Password: The password you chose in step 2.
