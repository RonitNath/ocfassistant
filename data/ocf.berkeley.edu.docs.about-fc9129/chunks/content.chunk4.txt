Policies for this cluster and decisions for the OCF organization are made by the OCF Board of Directors, an open body composed of OCF members who are interested in participating in the decision-making process.

The Board convenes at BoD Meetings, held every week when classes are in session, which are open to the public and provide a chance for any user to express their concerns or opinions about the OCF.

All OCF members are welcome to join the Board of Directors, and the general public is welcome to attend BoD Meetings. Minutes of all previous meetings are available online. How to find us The OCF is located on the ground floor of MLK Student Union. For hours and a map, see here .
