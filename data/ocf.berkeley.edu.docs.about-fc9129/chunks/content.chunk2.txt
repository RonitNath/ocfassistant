The Open Computing Facility provides free computing services to students, faculty, and staff, ranging from printing to expiration-free web hosting to Unix shell accounts to email.

Furthermore, the OCF operates a highly frequented long-hours computer lab with a generally high volunteer-staff-to-user ratio for accessible in-person support, as well as online support.

In addition to these user services, the group also hosts numerous student group and faculty/staff websites, and provides support to these and other organizations on campus.

To be able to do this, we are always aiming to secure more resources to fully meet the needs of everyone in the campus community.

Our primary resources are our GNU/Linux workstations and servers, entirely administered by student volunteers . These resources are located within our computing lab on the ground floor of MLK Student Union.
