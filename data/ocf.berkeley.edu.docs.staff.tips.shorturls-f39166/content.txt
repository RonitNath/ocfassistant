One of its functions is to shorten member website URLs: https://ocf.io/username is a shorturl for https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~username . We've additionally defined other shorturls. Here are some especially useful ones for staff: ocf.io/gh/ <repo> , ocf.io/github/ <repo> : The repository <repo> on the OCF GitHub page. There are also abbreviations for the most commonly used repositories: ocf.io/gh/i : ircbot ocf.io/gh/l : ocflib ocf.io/gh/p : puppet ocf.io/gh/u : utils ocf.io/gh/w : ocfweb ocf.io/rt : RT ocf.io/rt/ <ticketnum> : The page for ticket <ticketnum> in RT ocf.io/stats : Lab stats ocf.io/guest : If you bring a guest into the lab after hours, fill out this form ocf.io/servers : The server chart ocf.io/bod : BoD minutes We also often give out these shorturls in RT tickets: ocf.io/join : Signup page for an OCF account ocf.io/vhost : Info about virtual hosting ocf.io/vhost-mail : Info about mail virtual hosting ocf.io/apphost : Info about apphosting More shorturls You can find a full list of ocf.io shorturls in a table at ocf.io/shorturl . The shorturls are created in the Apache configuration via Puppet at ocf.io/shorturlpp . You can add additional shorturls to this list. When doing so, make sure that: The shorturl isn't already someone's username, so you don't accidentally break the ocf.io/username functionality for them. You add your shorturl to the list of reserved usernames . This way, no one will subsequently register an account with the same name as your shorturl and find that ocf.io/username doesn't work for them.
