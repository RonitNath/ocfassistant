Decrypt the backup using gpg . This requires your key pair to be imported into gpg first using gpg --import public_key.gpg and gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import private_key.gpg , then you can decrypt the backup with gpg --output <backup>.img.gz --decrypt <backup>.img.gz.gpg .

Be careful to keep your private key secure by setting good permissions on it so that nobody else can read it, and delete it after the backup is imported.

The keys can be deleted with gpg --delete-secret-keys "<Name>" and gpg --delete-key "<Name>" , where your name is whatever name it shows when you run gpg --list-keys . Extract the backup with gunzip <backup>.img.gz . Put the backup image into a LVM logical volume.

First find the size that the volume should be by running ls -l <backup>.img , and copy the number of bytes that outputs.

Then create the LV with sudo lvcreate -L <bytes>B -n <name> /dev/<volume group> where the volume group has enough space to store the entire backup (2+ TiB).
