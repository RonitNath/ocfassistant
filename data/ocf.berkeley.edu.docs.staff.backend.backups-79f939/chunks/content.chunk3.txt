If it is a directory specified in rsnapshot, then likely all that needs to be done is to take that directory from the backup and put it onto the server to restore onto.

Some backups, such as mysql, ldap, and kerberos are more complicated, and need to be restored using mysqlimport or ldapadd for instance.

Onsite Onsite backups are pretty simple, all that needs to be done is to go to hal and find the backup to restore from in /opt/backups/live .

All backups of recent data are found in either rsnapshot (for daily backups) or misc (for any incidents or one-off backups).

Within rsnapshot , the backups are organized into directories dependings on how long ago the backup was made.

To see when each backup was created just use ls -l to show the last modified time of each directory.
