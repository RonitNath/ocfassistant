(The incremental file backups are only about ~300 MiB, but since mysqldump files can't be incrementally backed up, those take a whole ~2 GiB each time, so the total backup grows by ~3GiB each time. However, an old backup is discarded each time too, so it approximately breaks even.)

Ideas for backup improvements Automate backup testing, so have some system for periodically checking that backups can be restored from, whether they are offsite or onsite.
