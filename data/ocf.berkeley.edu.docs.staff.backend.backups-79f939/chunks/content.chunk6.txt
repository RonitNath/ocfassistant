Backup Contents Backups currently include: Everything on NFS User home and web directories Cronjobs on supported servers (tsunami, supernova, biohazard, etc.)

MySQL databases (including user databases, stats, RT, print quotas, IRC data) Everything on GitHub (probably very unnecessary) LDAP and Kerberos data A smattering of random files on random servers Backup Procedures Backups are currently made daily via a cronjob on hal which calls rsnapshot .

The current settings are to retain 7 daily backups, 4 weekly backups, and 6 monthly backups, but we might adjust this as it takes more space or we get larger backup drives. We use rsnapshot to make incremental backups.

Typically, each new backup takes an additional ~3GiB of space (but this will vary based on how many files actually changed). A full backup is about ~2TiB of space and growing.
