~/.nvm/nvm.sh NODE_ENV=production PORT="/srv/apps/$USER/$USER.sock" \ exec ~/myapp/src/bin/www Replace ~/myapp/src/bin/www with the path to your app, then make run executable: chmod +x ~/myapp/run Test executing the run script. You should be able to access your website while running it (or see any errors in your terminal).

Supervise your app with systemd Cool, your app works. Set up systemd to supervise your app (so that it starts and restarts automatically). Suggestions/improvements?

If you have a better way to host Node.js-based apps on the app server (or a suggestion for how we could improve this documentation), send us an email !
