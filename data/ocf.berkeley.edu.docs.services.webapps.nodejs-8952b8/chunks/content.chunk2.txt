Setting up nvm Create a directory for your app to live in: mkdir -p ~/myapp cd ~/myapp Install nvm in your home directory. Note that nvm is terrible and will modify your shell config files without asking. But maybe that's what you want?

Go find the latest version from the NVM GitHub , and copy the nasty one-liner straight into your shell to install it.

At the time of writing, it looks like this: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash Go ahead and run it, and close/re-open your terminal as it suggests. Install whatever version of Node.js you want.

nvm install 6 nvm alias default 6 Copy your code to ~/myapp/src or similar, and install any dependencies using npm .

Preparing your app to be supervised Create a file at ~/myapp/run with content like: #!/bin/bash -e USER="$(whoami)" [ -e "/srv/apps/$USER/$USER.sock" ] && rm "/srv/apps/$USER/$USER.sock" umask 0 .
