A committee may spend funds only upon approval by a committee head and a Director who is not a head of said committee.

A committee head’s approval is void if there is a Director who makes their dissent known in a forum available to all directors within forty eight (48) hours of the approval, and that Director has not given their approval. Transactions of at least $100 require approval from the Board of Directors.

The Finance Committee may upon approval by the Board of Directors add additional restrictions to the use of committee budgets.
