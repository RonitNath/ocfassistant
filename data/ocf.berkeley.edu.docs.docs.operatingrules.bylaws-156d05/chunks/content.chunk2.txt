When putting a resolution to the Board in this manner, all Board members must be included in the request for votes.

To pass an issue this way, either at least half of all the Board members agree, or, quorum is achieved and a majority of voting Board members agree after allowing a period of forty-eight hours for Board members to vote.

If the motion fails to achieve quorum with a majority of voting Board members agreeing after forty-eight hours of being called to such a vote, the motion fails. The results of the vote will be posted in roll call form.

Attendance lists and minutes for all OCF meetings shall be maintained for the decisions of that meeting to be valid.

BoD appointments and removals will take effect at 12:00 midnight after the conclusion of the meeting at which the appointment or removal took place.
