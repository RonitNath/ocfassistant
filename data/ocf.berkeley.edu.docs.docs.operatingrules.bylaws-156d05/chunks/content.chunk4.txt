In that case, they shall be automatically appointed unless at the same meeting a Director moves for a vote on their appointment, in which case the candidate will be appointed unless more than three-fifths of Directors present vote against their appointment. The Board of Directors may select and recall a Faculty Sponsor for the OCF.

During the final meeting of each Fall and Spring semester, each Director will be asked to confirm their ability to serve as a Director during the following Fall semester or Spring semester. Directors who do not confirm or are not present will be removed from the Board.

Any director who is banned from the OCF or has their account disabled due to misuse will be removed from the board and is not eligible for membership on the Board of Directors.
