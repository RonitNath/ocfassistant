<ol>
<li><p>[Repealed]</p>
</li>
<li><p>The OCF Board of Directors shall meet at least once every two weeks while
the OCF is formally in session.</p>
</li>

two consecutive regularly scheduled meetings will be removed from the Board,
regardless of whether the meetings achieve quorum.</p>
</li>
<li><p>OCF Board meetings must be announced to all Directors at least twenty-four
hours in advance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Resolutions by the Board of Directors can be put to a vote electronically.
When putting a resolution to the Board in this manner, all Board members
must be included in the request for votes. To pass an issue this way,
either at least half of all the Board members agree, or, quorum is achieved
and a majority of voting Board members agree after allowing a period of
forty-eight hours for Board members to vote. If the motion fails to achieve
quorum with a majority of voting Board members agreeing after forty-eight
hours of being called to such a vote, the motion fails. The results of the
vote will be posted in roll call form.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attendance lists and minutes for all OCF meetings shall be maintained for
the decisions of that meeting to be valid.</p>
</li>
<li><p>BoD appointments and removals will take effect at 12:00 midnight after the

OCF alumni, and other individuals or groups that are external to
UC Berkeley, and manages OCF public relations and image.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Finance Committee oversees the finances of the OCF and  ensures
that the OCF is adequately funded. The Finance Committee should also

</li>

Director who is not a head of said committee.</p>
</li>

approval.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transactions of at least $100 require approval from the Board of
