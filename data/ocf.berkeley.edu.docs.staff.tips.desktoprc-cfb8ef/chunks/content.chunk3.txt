For example, to automatically connect to the OCF's IRC server, try this snippet: mkdir -p ~/.config/hexchat echo " v=2.12.4 N=ocf L=7 E=UTF-8 (Unicode) F=30 D=0 S=irc.ocf.berkeley.edu/6697 J=#rebuild " > ~/.config/hexchat/servlist.conf For more complex configs, you always have the option to edit your server list from the GUI, then copy and paste servlist.conf into your .desktoprc .
