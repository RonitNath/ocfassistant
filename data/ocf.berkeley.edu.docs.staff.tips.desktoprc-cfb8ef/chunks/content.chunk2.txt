Sync your dotfiles If you want your application settings shared between the desktops and login servers, you can just copy them over with a line like this: cp ~/remote/{.bashrc, .bash_aliases, .vimrc, ...} ~/ Alternatively, if you have a dotfile repo , you can either clone it... git clone https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/my-install-script ... or just link to it in your NFS homedir, if you have it there: ln -s ~/remote/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/my-install-script Configure HexChat (IRC) We install HexChat as a desktop IRC client.
