Since ~/remote is actually sshfs 'd to your home folder on NFS, this means you can put your common config or preferences in it and have them be shared across all desktops. Example uses If you want to get a feel for what you can do with your .desktoprc , try out some of these useful ideas. Sync your dotfiles If you want your application settings shared between the desktops and login servers, you can just copy them over with a line like this: cp ~/remote/{.bashrc, .bash_aliases, .vimrc, ...} ~/ Alternatively, if you have a dotfile repo , you can either clone it... git clone https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/my-install-script ... or just link to it in your NFS homedir, if you have it there: ln -s ~/remote/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/my-install-script Configure HexChat (IRC) We install HexChat as a desktop IRC client. You can automatically configure it to connect to your favorite networks on startup. For example, to automatically connect to the OCF's IRC server, try this snippet: mkdir -p ~/.config/hexchat echo " v=2.12.4 N=ocf L=7 E=UTF-8 (Unicode) F=30 D=0 S=irc.ocf.berkeley.edu/6697 J=#rebuild " > ~/.config/hexchat/servlist.conf For more complex configs, you always have the option to edit your server list from the GUI, then copy and paste servlist.conf into your .desktoprc . Disable terminal shortcuts The XFCE4 terminal emulator installed on the desktops comes with keyboard shortcuts by default. If these bother you, you can disable them like this: echo " ShortcutsNoHelpkey=TRUE ShortcutsNoMenukey=TRUE ShortcutsNoMnemonics=TRUE " >> ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/terminalrc Edit this Page Page History Table of Contents Example uses Sync your dotfiles Configure HexChat (IRC) Disable terminal shortcuts More in this category Tips and tricks .desktoprc Email Templates On your staff VM Installing and running ZNC Running ocfweb ShortURL guide ShortURL table Test accounts Using Twitch and OBS OCF ♥ Linux , Kubernetes , Python , Nix , and Free/Open-Source Software.
