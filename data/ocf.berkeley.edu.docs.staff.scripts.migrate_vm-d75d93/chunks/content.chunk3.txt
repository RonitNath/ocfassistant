The section to delete looks like this: <cpu mode= 'custom' match= 'exact' > <model fallback= 'allow' > Opteron_G3 </model> </cpu> Then, after everything works, you should remove the old KVM and LVM definitions on only the old host: sudo virsh undefine ${hostname} sudo lvremove /dev/vg/${hostname} Assumptions Made The LVM volume group /dev/vg is used on both the old and new host. Virtual machines are stored at /dev/vg/${hostname} on both hosts.
