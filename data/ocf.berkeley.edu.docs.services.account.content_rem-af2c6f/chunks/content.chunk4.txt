DMCA considerations If you require content to be taken down under the DMCA for copyright reasons, you may send a DMCA takedown notice to the University, which will forward the request to us.

Do not send any notices to the OCF directly; we can only act on them if they are sent to our designated agent.

You must certify under penalty of perjury that your request is valid, that you are the rightsholder for the content in question, and that the use of the content does not fall under fair use exemptions to the DMCA.

If you believe you have a valid DMCA claim against an OCF member, we suggest that you seek legal advice prior to filing a takedown notice.
