If repeated attempts to contact the owner of the account have failed, you may contact us and request the website be disabled due to inactivity. If we attempt to contact the website owner and fail to get a response, we may disable their account as per our account policies .

However, if the website owner responds and refuses your removal request, the OCF cannot take any further action on your behalf unless the website is in violation of our account policies .

If you believe this is the case, you may notify us of the exact policy you believe to have been breached, and if we determine the complaint to be valid, we will take appropriate action on our end.

Please note that, if the above steps fail, the website is likely being maintained in compliance with our policies. There is nothing the OCF can do to change this outcome. Please do not assume that we support or endorse information posted by our members.
