~/myapp/venv/bin/activate PYTHONPATH=~/myapp/src:$PYTHONPATH \ exec gunicorn -w 2 -b unix:/srv/apps/$(whoami)/$(whoami).sock \ --log-file - main:app Replace main:app with the module containing the app, and name of your app, then make run executable: chmod +x ~/myapp/run Test executing the run script. You should be able to access your website while running it (or see any errors in your terminal).

Supervise your app with systemd Cool, your app works. Set up systemd to supervise your app (so that it starts and restarts automatically). Bonus Gunicorn tip: reloading your app Gunicorn will reload your app if you send it SIGHUP.

You can teach systemd that fact by adding the following line under [Service] in your systemd unit file: ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID and then running systemctl --user daemon-reload .

After that, you can use systemctl to reload your app: systemctl --user reload myapp Suggestions/improvements?
