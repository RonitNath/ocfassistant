This is the most ideal method of using a prewritten exporter, like the Apache or Postfix exporters, both of which we use. An example of this is in the Prometheus server config . Run your exporter in Kubernetes if it doesn't matter which host it runs on. This is how we run the SNMP exporter. Again, this is done in the Prometheus server config . Custom Queries Prometheus supports querying a wide variety of metrics. (For a full list, go to Prometheus and use the "insert metric at cursor" dropdown.)

A basic query comes in the form: metric{label="value", label2="value2", ...} Some labels used frequently are: instance: The name of the device that the data was collected from. Some examples are papercut , avalanche , or supernova . host_type: The type of device that is being queried. Valid types are desktop , server , and staffvm . job: The name of the job/exporter that collected the data. Some examples are node , printer , and slurm .
