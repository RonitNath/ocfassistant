While we do not proactively disable accounts without emails, if we need to contact you for any reason and cannot, your account will be disabled. This is true for both individual and group accounts. Student groups We provide email virtual hosting for student groups who have a virtual host (e.g. mygroup.studentorg.berkeley.edu). See here for instructions on requesting email hosting and configuring email addresses.

Individual accounts Mail service for individual accounts was discontinued over summer 2014, but we are still offering email forwarding for individual accounts indefinitely. Note that sending mail from your individual OCF account is no longer possible.
