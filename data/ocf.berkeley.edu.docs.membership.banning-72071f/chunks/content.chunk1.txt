Any member of the OCF staff may propose to ban a user from the OCF for willful violation of OCF policies. Banned users may not enter the OCF lab or use any OCF services.

Once a user is proposed to be banned, all staff with any involvement with the user will be called to the next Board of Directors meeting, and those present shall testify. The Board of Directors may then decide to ban the user with a ⅔ majority vote.
