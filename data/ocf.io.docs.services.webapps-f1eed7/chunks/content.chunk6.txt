Otherwise, an example would be: #!/bin/sh -e exec ~/myapp/run-server Your server should run in the foreground (it should not daemonize), and the run script should end with an exec line so that signals are sent to the server (and not to the shell that started it). Once you've written the script, make it executable ( chmod +x ~/myapp/run ). Test it by executing it in your terminal before moving on; it will be easier to debug problems. Write a systemd service file so your app will be supervised on startup.
