Occasionally, it is useful to allow someone to reset a group account password online when they are not a signatory, namely when the account is not for a registered student organization. This is done by associating the user's CalNet ID with the account record in LDAP. Open the LDAP record for editing.

$ kinit <staffusername>/admin ldapvi uid=<username> After looking up the user's UID in the University directory , add it to the record with a line like this: calnetUid: 6081 If the mail attribute is missing, but you know of a contact email address for the account, please add it as well. Save the file to update LDAP. Now, the user can change the account password online .

CalNet association is only meant to be temporary and must be reverted once the password has been reset by removing this line.

It can cause problems with individual/group acount detection in scripts if an account has both callinkOid and calnetUid fields.
