Similarly, group accounts have a callinkOid attribute.

Old accounts, especially if previously disabled, may be missing the calnetUID or callinkOid attribute. Please add it when enabling accounts. If unknown or a group other than a registered student organization, set it to 0 .

The 0 is still useful for distinguishing between individuals and groups based on the attribute name.
