It displays a concerning lack of attention, care, and respect for the student body from administrators who are purportedly here for the benefit of the students. We also condemn the use of the OCF name in this announcement.

The OCF's (and by extension the student body's) concerns were not "carefully considered", instead they were wholly ignored.
