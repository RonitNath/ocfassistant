This is done automatically after every Puppet run which results in iptables rules being modified, but if you manually fiddle with iptables you may need to run it yourself.

Disabling firewalls through hiera In an emergency, it's possible to effectively disable firewalling of input traffic on a server by setting ocf::firewall::reject_unrecognized_input to false in that server's hieradata.

Turning on this option causes the rules in the PUPPET-INPUT chain which reject traffic to be deleted, effectively disabling the firewall's function of filtering input packets.

An analogous kill switch does not currently exist for output-traffic firewalling, but can be easily added.
