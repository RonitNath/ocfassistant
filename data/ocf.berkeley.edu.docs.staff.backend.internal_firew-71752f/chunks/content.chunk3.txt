In addition to input rules, it's necessary to have some output rules as well to protect devices that we don't trust to have reliable firewalls, such as printers and IPMI devices.

The rules for those devices work a little differently: A handful of "uber-trusted" servers, such as supernova and hypervisors, are allowed to talk to all of these special devices. This allows us to use these servers for the purposes of configuring or debugging those devices. Some other servers can talk to certain special devices. For example, the print server can talk to printers. Most other hosts cannot talk to these special devices.

Output rules are not a perfect solution, since they operate on a voluntary mechanism and can't prevent non-OCF hosts that may be connected to our network from contacting these special devices anyway. Preventing this is a future project.
