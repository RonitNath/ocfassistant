We may be able to install additional packages on request, but will generally advise you to use alternatives instead (such as installing in a virtualenv or inside your home directory). FAQ My public_html directory is missing, how do I fix that?

We automatically create the public_html symlink for all new accounts, but it's possible that it was accidentally removed (or that you have an older account from before we started the practice).

Keep in mind that just recreating the directory is not sufficient; it must be a symbolic link to your actual web space. If you simply make a directory named public_html , it won't be used for your website.
