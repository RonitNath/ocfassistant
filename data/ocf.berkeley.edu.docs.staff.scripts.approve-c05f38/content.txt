When to use approve OCF group accounts need to be manually approved by staff in the lab. All members requesting individual accounts should be directed to the online approval page. If a member requesting an individual account cannot use the online approval system (likely because of an invalid/unacceptable CalNet UID), direct them to an OCF officer. Approving a request The approve program can only be run from supernova. Before approve SSH into supernova.ocf.berkeley.edu For registered student groups, the OCF requires that a signatory authorize the approval of the account. If the account is not a registered student group, check with the membership eligibility to see what constitutes acceptable documentation. If the group is a registered student group, you can look up the requester's signatory status by name with signat . $ signat name matthew mcallister Searching for people... Found 1 entry. Searching for signatories... MATTHEW JAMES Mcallister (1031366) ================================== Group Accounts OID ----------------------- --------------------------- ----- Open Computing Facility decal, linux, ggroup, group 46187 Copy the group's OID, as you will need it when running approve. If the group is not a student group, the requester will need an official letterhead giving them authority to create the account. You will also need to check that the group doesn't already have an account using checkacct . $ checkacct privacy Login: bipla Name: Berkeley Information Privacy Law Association Finally, check that the name on the requester's Cal ID matches who they say they are. Running approve When you run approve it will open a text editor; just fill out the form, save it, and let the requester enter a password when prompted. For reference, user_name will be the username used to log in to the newly-created account, group_name is the full name of the group, e.g. 'Open Computing Facility', and email should ideally point somewhere that will be read by whoever will be maintaining the account. signatory has been deprecated. Optionally, if you pass the OID as the only argument, the group_name , callink_oid , and email fields will get filled in automatically using the group's public information on CalLink. If the group is not a student group, (e.g. a research group), use 0 as the OID. Post approval Explain to the requesters that they will need to apply for virtual hosting after they have set up their site if they wish to do so. Point them to relevant wiki articles.
