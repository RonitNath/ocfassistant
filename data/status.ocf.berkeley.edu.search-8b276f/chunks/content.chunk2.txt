Posted by Jonathan at 10:38 PM Thursday, February 08, 2024 OCF Mirrors Down, Feb 8 ~11AM - Feb 10 9PM Update (2/10 9PM PST) - OCF Mirrors Service is up again, and we are currently syncing from upstreams. OCF Internal APT repos remain unavailable at this moment. The OCF Mirrors Service went down due to a campus datacenter power outage. When power was resumed, the server encountered a disk error on the boot disk. ETA of recovery currently unknown as a full OS rebuild seems to be needed.
