Later this semester, we will migrate the mirrors server to the campus datacenter to ease up the network load at the OCF lab*. The project is currently in the planning stages, so no definite dates are available. However, we will make a separate post on the status blog before we proceed with the migration.

It is likely that the server's IP addresses will fall outside of the OCF subnet as a result of the migration.
