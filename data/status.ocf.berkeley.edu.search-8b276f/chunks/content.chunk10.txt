Update 7:14PM 2021-11-13: We have been told to leave the build which hosts our servers by the Student Union staff, therefore we likely will not be able to bring things back up until Monday. Update 4:49AM 2021-11-14: Most services are now up. We are working on bringing scurvy (staff VM, Berkeleytime etc.) up.

Update 5:28AM 2021-11-14: Scurvy is up, berkeleytime is up, hellfire is up, marking this as RESOLVED?
