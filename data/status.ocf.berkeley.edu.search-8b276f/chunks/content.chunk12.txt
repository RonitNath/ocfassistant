We expect to have 3 TiB of usable disk space on the mirrors server following the removal of centos-debuginfo, so if you have any suggestions for open source projects to mirror, please also email us at help@ocf.berkeley.edu :) We are currently discussing adding ubuntu-ports.

rjz OCF Staff Posted by Jonathan at 1:02 PM Monday, October 11, 2021 [Investigating] Mirrors disk status 10/11 0000 PST: We noticed that one disk attribute was abnormal on multiple disks in the mirrors server.

All SMART attributes are currently normal, so we currently do not expect any immediate service interruption as we investigate the issue. 10/12: Scheduled maintenance at 1930 PST. ETA 15 mins. We will update this post once we have more information on the situation.
