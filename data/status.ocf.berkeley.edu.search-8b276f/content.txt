While the electrical shutdown does not affect the campus data center, the availability of the OCF Software Mirror service. The OCF HPC service will be unavailable during the outage. Posted by Jonathan at 10:42 PM Planned Outage: OCF Mirrors, Aug. 11 Due to a scheduled power outage at the UC Berkeley Earl Warren Data Center, OCF Mirrors (https://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu) will be unavailable starting 4 AM PDT, Sunday Aug. 11. The server is expected to be online by 7 PM PDT, Sunday Aug. 11. Posted by Jonathan at 10:38 PM Thursday, February 08, 2024 OCF Mirrors Down, Feb 8 ~11AM - Feb 10 9PM Update (2/10 9PM PST) - OCF Mirrors Service is up again, and we are currently syncing from upstreams. OCF Internal APT repos remain unavailable at this moment. The OCF Mirrors Service went down due to a campus datacenter power outage. When power was resumed, the server encountered a disk error on the boot disk. ETA of recovery currently unknown as a full OS rebuild seems to be needed. ~rjz Posted by Jonathan at 11:28 PM Wednesday, January 18, 2023 Mirrors maintenance, 1/18 23:00 PST We'll be running some maintenance tasks on the mirrors server (https://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu) at 23:00 PST today, 1/18. The projected maintenance window is 20 minutes. Posted by Jonathan at 2:31 PM Friday, August 26, 2022 Multiple mirrors out of date We noticed that multiple OCF mirror archives were out of date due to exhausted boot disk space on the mirrors server. Affected archives include (this is not an exhaustive list): Debian Debian-security Puppetlabs Ubuntu Ubuntu-ports Kali The last update of the affected archives was on Aug 13. Sync is running but might take a while. We sincerely apologize for this. We will take steps to ensure that system monitoring alerts are handled in a timely manner. Posted by Jonathan at 11:49 PM Friday, May 13, 2022 Fedora out of sync I noticed that our Fedora mirror was out of sync due to a slow upstream mirror. Working on it. Update: Switched to another upstream mirror. Sync speeds are higher now. Posted by Jonathan at 2:58 AM Saturday, April 02, 2022 [RESOLVED] Raspbian out of sync We noticed that our Raspbian mirror is out of sync, likely due to the IP address change. 10:16 PM - We have temporarily switched our upstream for the Raspbian mirror, and it's currently syncing. Emailed Raspbian. - rjz 5/13 - Resolved. Posted by Jonathan at 10:09 PM Tuesday, March 15, 2022 Emergency mirrors server maintenance today The OCF mirrors server will be down for about an hour staring 1300 PDT today due to a required move within the rack and IPv6 provisioning. We apologize for the inconvenience. Posted by Jonathan at 12:01 PM Sunday, March 13, 2022 Emergency maintenance: hypervisors reboot today We will be rebooting the hypervisors this afternoon at about 2 pm to apply the updated kernel that fixes several high-severity vulnerabilities. The downtime will be around 15-30 minutes, and all websites hosted by the OCF as well as the login servers, Matrix server, Slack bridge, mail server, and the IRC server will be unavailable during the reboot. Posted by Jonathan at 1:43 PM Friday, March 11, 2022 [Complete, see notes] Mirrors downtime 3/11/2022 - migration to campus DC migration to campus DC underway, expect downtime for ~2 hours Update 3/12/2022: Migration completed by 14:00 yesterday. Currently our mirrors are IPv4 only, IPv6 ETA 2 weeks. Some Kali packages may not download correctly due to campus firewall settings, so if you experience any broken Kali downloads, please switch to the https version of our mirror. We are in contact with the university to get the issue sorted out as soon as possible. Posted by Jonathan at 10:28 AM Monday, February 14, 2022 Mirrors maintenance tonight at 8 We will be installing additional RAM on the mirrors server tonight at 8pm. Expect 15 mins of downtime. Update: ETA 2130. Apologies, but the process turned out to be more involved than expected. Update 2: The mirrors are up as of 21:30. Posted by Jonathan at 12:04 PM Tuesday, February 08, 2022 Scheduled downtime on Saturday, 2/12 We will be upgrading the operating system on our web hosting (death), login (tsunami), and app hosting (vampires) servers this Saturday, 2/12/2022, beginning at 6:00 pm Pacific Time. All OCF-hosted websites and apps will be unavailable during the upgrade. We expect the downtime to last for about 4 hours. We apologize for the inconvenience. Posted by Jonathan at 11:39 AM Friday, February 04, 2022 Mirrors upgrade underway, service interruptions expected We are currently performing upgrades on the OCF mirrors server to accommodate more projects and improve the throughput. During this time, you might experience sporadic downtime and reduced performance. Please retry your downloads in a few seconds if you experience failures when downloading from the OCF mirrors. We apologize for any inconvenience. We expect the upgrades to be completed by mid-February. Later this semester, we will migrate the mirrors server to the campus datacenter to ease up the network load at the OCF lab*. The project is currently in the planning stages, so no definite dates are available. However, we will make a separate post on the status blog before we proceed with the migration. It is likely that the server's IP addresses will fall outside of the OCF subnet as a result of the migration. Planned additions as of 2/6 2230PST (please note, this list is not final and may change without notice): Fedora - initial sync underway OpenSUSE - initial sync underway Gentoo - up Ubuntu Ports (releases) - up Blender - up Debian non-free images - initial sync underway Xfce CentOS Stream - initial sync underway Rocky Linux - initial sync underway Qubes OS - up Feel free to email help@ocf.berkeley.edu if you have any suggestions :) *: subject to change Posted by Jonathan at 7:47 PM Friday, January 21, 2022 Planned server reboot on 1/22 We will be rebooting our servers on Saturday, 1/22 at 2:00 PM PST for kernel updates.

Posted by Jonathan at 5:47 AM Monday, November 01, 2021 [RESOLVED] Scheduled downtime on 11/13 We are planning on having some scheduled downtime on Saturday 11/13 starting around 12:00pm PST. We expect to be done before 4pm. We will be rebooting our main hypervisor as well as some other machines.

Update 3:57PM 2021-11-13: We have experienced some issues updating our main production server, so we expect to take at least another hour. We apologize for the inconvenience. Update 7:14PM 2021-11-13: We have been told to leave the build which hosts our servers by the Student Union staff, therefore we likely will not be able to bring things back up until Monday. Update 4:49AM 2021-11-14: Most services are now up. We are working on bringing scurvy (staff VM, Berkeleytime etc.) up. Update 5:28AM 2021-11-14: Scurvy is up, berkeleytime is up, hellfire is up, marking this as RESOLVED?

Please email us at help [at] ocf.berkeley.edu (or send a message in #rebuild) if you experience any issues. Posted by Jonathan at 5:31 PM centos-debuginfo mirror decommissioning For years, we have been mirroring the centos-debuginfo project, which hosts the *-debuginfo packages for CentOS. However, our centos-debuginfo mirror is an unofficial one, and is not listed on the CentOS website. Our traffic statistics show that the mirror has no to negligible actual usage, with tens to hundreds of megabytes of data transferred daily (almost entirely by bots). The project currently occupies 2.7 TiB of disk space, which is the highest of all the projects we mirror, and yet no user is actually using it. As a result, we will decommission the centos-debuginfo mirror on Saturday, October 30, 2021 at around 1200 PDT. The project will continue to be synced in the meantime. If you are currently using our centos-debuginfo mirror, or if you have any concerns or questions, please email us as soon as possible at help@ocf.berkeley.edu. We expect to have 3 TiB of usable disk space on the mirrors server following the removal of centos-debuginfo, so if you have any suggestions for open source projects to mirror, please also email us at help@ocf.berkeley.edu :) We are currently discussing adding ubuntu-ports. rjz OCF Staff Posted by Jonathan at 1:02 PM Monday, October 11, 2021 [Investigating] Mirrors disk status 10/11 0000 PST: We noticed that one disk attribute was abnormal on multiple disks in the mirrors server. All SMART attributes are currently normal, so we currently do not expect any immediate service interruption as we investigate the issue. 10/12: Scheduled maintenance at 1930 PST. ETA 15 mins. We will update this post once we have more information on the situation.
