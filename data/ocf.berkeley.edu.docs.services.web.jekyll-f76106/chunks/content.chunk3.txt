user@tsunami:~/jekyll$ bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle' user@tsunami:~/jekyll$ bundle install Deploy your new site Change the baseurl option in _config.yml file to the path you want your site available at.

This is likely something like "/~username" or "/~username/blog" (make sure to replace username with your username!).

Build the site in ~/public_html (make sure to also run this whenever you make changes to your site and want to publish them).

This path should match whatever you used for your baseurl option, so if you chose "/~username" there, then use ~/public_html here, if you chose "/~username/blog" then use ~/public_html/blog here instead: user@tsunami:~/jekyll$ bundle exec jekyll build -d ~/public_html Your site should now be up at https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~username (or whatever path you chose previously).
