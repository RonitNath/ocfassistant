Create a new directory for your Jekyll project and name it whatever you want, then enter that directory: user@tsunami:~$ mkdir jekyll user@tsunami:~$ cd jekyll Install the Jekyll gem and set up your site. Note that the specific jekyll path is only needed for setup since jekyll is being installed for only your user, but after this setup, you can just add bundle exec before any jekyll-related commands to get them to work: user@tsunami:~/jekyll$ gem install --user jekyll # The path used for jekyll below should be printed out as a warning when you # install jekyll using the above command, it'll be something like # "/home/u/us/username/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin/jekyll" but can vary # by Ruby version. Use `gem environment` to find the appropriate path. user@tsunami:~/jekyll$ ~/.local/share/gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin/jekyll new --skip-bundle .
