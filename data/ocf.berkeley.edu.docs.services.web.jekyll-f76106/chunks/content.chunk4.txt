Let's see how to customize it a bit to make it yours: On your site, there should be a new welcome post (at some path like https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~username/jekyll/current-date/welcome-to-jekyll.html ).

This contains instructions on how to add a new post, but we've summarized the instructions below: In your site directory ( jekyll for instance), there should be a subdirectory named _posts . Blog posts go there by default as Markdown files.

Please follow the sample post file there to make your own (note the YAML header at the top in between --- markers and the file name format with the date and a title). Other than blog posts, you can also make other pages (about, contact, etc.) that are linked at the top right of the site.

An example is the about.md file already placed in your site directory (note the YAML header with layout: page to specify which layout to use).
