If you are in ocfroot you can push this directly to puppet and trigger a puppet run on your staffvm ( sudo puppet-trigger -fe <user> ) otherwise, push to your fork and submit a pull request and someone will merge it for you, after which you can trigger the puppet run on your VM.

Furthermore, you will need to install the libcrack2-dev package so that the crypto libraries ocfweb depends on will successfully compile.
