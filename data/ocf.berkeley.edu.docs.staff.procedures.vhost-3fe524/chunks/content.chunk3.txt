Keep in mind that vhosts are not available without HTTPS, so there may be a short period of time where the new vhost is unavailable or giving a certificate error.

Next, request the following DNS record from the University hostmaster : hostname.studentorg.berkeley.edu. IN CNAME hosting.ocf.berkeley.edu. Use the domain requested by the group in place of hostname . We have a reusable email template for making new DNS requests. This email should be sent to hostmaster@nic.berkeley.edu and sm+vhost@ocf.berkeley.edu. Make sure to include the name and CalLink OID of the requesting RSO.

Answers to the following questions (provided by the requestor of the subdomain) should be sent to the University hostmaster along with the DNS request itself.
