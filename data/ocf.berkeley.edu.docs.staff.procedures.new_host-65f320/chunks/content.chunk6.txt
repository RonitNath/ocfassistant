Find out what the ethernet interface's name and current IP address is by running ip addr . The ethernet interface should be named something like eno1 or enp4s2 . (In the following instructions, substitute eno1 with the correct name.)

Remove the incorrect IP addresses with ip addr del $WRONG_ADDRESS dev eno1 . Add the correct IP addresses with ip addr add $CORRECT_ADDRESS dev eno1 . Make sure that $CORRECT_ADDRESS includes the netmask. puppet agent --test Step 4.
