On desktops, you sometimes need to enable this in the BIOS before you can select it from the boot menu. Be warned that the default action (automated install) happens after 5 seconds. So don't PXE-boot your laptop and walk away! We preseed a bunch of settings (random questions, mirror locations, packages, etc.). The install should be completely hands-free, and will restart to a login tty. Step 3. Log in and start Puppet Virtual hosts The makevm script at the very end drops you into a shell. In this shell, you should run: puppet agent --test . Physical hosts Log in as root:r00tme . You can change the password if you want, but don't have to (Puppet will change it soon anyway). Make sure the IP address and hostname is set correctly.
