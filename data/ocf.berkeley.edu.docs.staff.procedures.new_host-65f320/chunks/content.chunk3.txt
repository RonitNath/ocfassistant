(New hosts only) Add to LDAP, DNS, Puppet, Kerberos Only do these if a server with this hostname has never existed before (or if it's been long enough that some of these steps have never been done before). Unfortunately, these steps tend to change a lot as our infrastructure evolves. Step 1.1. Add the LDAP entry On supernova, kinit $USER/admin ldap-add-host <hostname> <ip-last-octet> . <ip-last-octet> is the part after the last . in the IP address, like 42 for the address 169.229.226.42 . If setting up a desktop, add a final argument desktop , which will set the type to desktop . If doing a staff VM, add to staffvm instead. Step 1.2.

Add the DNS record Clone the DNS repo from GitHub, run make , and push a commit with the new records. Step 1.3.

Add node config to Puppet Only do this if you are creating a staff VM, a server which will run a service, or a special snowflake.
