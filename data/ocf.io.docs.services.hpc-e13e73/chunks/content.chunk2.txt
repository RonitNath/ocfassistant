Introduction At the OCF we offer a High Performance Computing (HPC) service for individuals and groups that need to run computationally demanding software.

We currently have one main HPC server; however, we have plans to expand the cluster to make use the resources at our disposal.

Gaining Access In order to access the HPC cluster, please send an access request to help@ocf.berkeley.edu .

Make sure to include your OCF username or group account name and a detailed technical description of the projects you plan to run on our HPC infrastructure.

This would include information about the nature of the software being run, as well as the amount of computational resources that are expected to be needed.
