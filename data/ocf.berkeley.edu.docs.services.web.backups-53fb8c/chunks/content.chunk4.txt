Particularly, if you are using WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal, you will have to backup your database alongside your web directory. MySQL If you are using a MySQL database, you can use mysqldump to make snapshots.

Instructions are on the MySQL page, but the basic syntax to make a backup is mysqldump username > ~/backup.sql and, to restore, is mysql -D username < ~/backup.sql You should compress these files with gzip as they can be quite large. The above commands can be modified to do this.

To save, mysqldump username | gzip -c > ~/backup.sql.gz and, to restore, gzip -dc ~/backup.sql.gz | mysql -D username Using .my.cnf By default, you have to enter your MySQL every time you make a backup, which is inconvenient.

Worse, if you forget the password and uses makemysql to reset it, it will break your old website backups!

If you want to save the trouble, follow our instructions to create ~/.my.cnf which will allow you to use MySQL without entering the password by hand.
