If you have a folder ~/backups created, you can save your website ~/public_html there with the following command: tar czhf ~/backups/backup.tar.gz ~/public_html To restore the backup, you would first remove the contents of ~/public_html (i.e. rm -r ~/public_html ) and then extract the compressed file.

cd ~/public_html tar xzhf ~/backups/backup.tar.gz WARNING Do not try to backup your public_html folder by copying it directly! It is not a real directory, but a link to where the files are actually stored.

Instead, explicitly copy all the files inside to another directory or use the the commands on this page which were written to do so.
