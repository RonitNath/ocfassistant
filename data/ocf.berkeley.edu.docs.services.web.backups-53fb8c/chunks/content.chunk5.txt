Taking down a site If you have an old website you want to archive and remove from public view, you can make a backup of it using the above instructions and then delete your webiste files and database.

When deleting files, be sure to delete the contents inside of public_html and not just public_html itself, which is a mere link.

The easiest way to remove the contents of your database is to log into phpMyAdmin at https://pma.ocf.berkeley.edu with your OCF username and MySQL password. There, you can select all tables using the check boxes and select Drop to delete them all.

If you instead wanted to delete the whole database, you could use the command mysqladmin -uusername -p drop username However, you would need to run makemysql to create a new database, which would permanently change your password.

Example backup Suppose your OCF account name is johndoe and you have WordPress installed directly in ~/public_html .
