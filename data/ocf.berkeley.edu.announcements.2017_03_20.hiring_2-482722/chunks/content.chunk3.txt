Operations Manager The Operations Manager will have the same responsibilities as the Operations Assistants (see above), except they will spend less time staffing the front desk of the OCF, and instead will spend the remaining time performing more managerial duties, such as leading meetings with the Operations Assistants, delegating projects, and scheduling shifts for the OCF front desk.

This job will involve more responsibilities and use of communication skills than the Operations Assistant role, but it is also paid more, at $15.75 per hour. See the full job description for more details. Application Applications closed on Tuesday, April 7th at 11:59 PM.
