March 20, 2017 Update April 8, 2017: The application period is over and we are no longer accepting applicants. Thank you so much to everyone who applied!

The OCF is making a big transition to having a completely self-staffed front desk next semester, and as part of that process, we are looking to hire students to be OCF Operations staff for the 2017-2018 academic year!

This includes two paid positions, Operations Assistant and Operations Manager, neither of which require any technical experience.
