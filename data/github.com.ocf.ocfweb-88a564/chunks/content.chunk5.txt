Please don't push to master with failing testsâ€”Jenkins will refuse to deploy your code, and nobody will be able to deploy until it's fixed.

If you make a pull request to the OCF GitHub organization from your fork of ocfweb, Jenkins will attempt to build and test your branch automatically.

If your build fails, you can log into Jenkins to see which tests you've failed and fix them, if running make test locally didn't already tell you.

You can run individual tests with venv/bin/pytest -k <test_name> or venv/bin/pytest <test_file>::<test_name> if running all tests is too slow. Running pre-commit We use pre-commit to lint our code before commiting.

While some of the rules might seem a little arbitrary, it helps keep the style consistent, and ensure annoying things like trailing whitespace don't creep in.

You can simply run make install-hooks to install the necessary git hooks; once installed, pre-commit will run every time you commit.
