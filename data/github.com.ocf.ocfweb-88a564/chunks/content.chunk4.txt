Working on ocfweb We recommend following all of these steps on supernova , the staff login server, because it is already configured to run ocfweb in development mode with minimal extra setup.

Clone the repo, and be sure to check out submodules: $ git submodule update --init $ make install-hooks If you get an error about not being able to import bootstrap, it's because you forgot to run the second command. Running in development mode On supernova [0] run make dev . The first time will take a while, but future runs will be almost instant thanks to pip-faster .

It will start listening on a deterministically random port (really, 8000 plus the last 3 digits of your user id) which is printed to you. You can then view the site in development. Building SCSS Run make scss to build SCSS. You can also use make watch-scss to rebuild it automatically when SCSS files change. Running tests To run tests locally, run make test .
