One must first install ifenslave , and identify the physical interfaces that will be slaved to the bond virtual interface.

Then, write the following to the config file: auto bond0 iface bond0 inet manual slaves <iface> <iface> ... bond-mode 802.3ad bond-miimon 100 bond-lacp-rate 1 What do these options mean? The first line indicates the interfaces that are going to participate in the bond.

The corresponding ports on the switch are the ones that are going to be aggregated into a channel-group/port-channel.

The second line configures the type of aggregation, 802.3ad in our case, while the third configures the frequency in miliseconds that the interfaces are inspected for link failure and the fourth indicates the rate at which LACP PDUs are sent, 1 implying "fast", at a PDU sent every second instead of every 30 seconds ("slow").
