What is ZNC? ZNC is an IRC bouncer .

It keeps you always connected to IRC, and allows you to connect to the bouncer from your desktop client, irssi, phone, etc. It's handy to avoid constantly disconnecting/reconnecting from IRC. It will also store messages you've missed and replay them when you log in. It's useful along with OCF's IRC server . Installing ZNC on your staff VM sudo apt-get install znc Create a config file for ZNC. As your user (i.e. not as root), run znc --makeconf .
