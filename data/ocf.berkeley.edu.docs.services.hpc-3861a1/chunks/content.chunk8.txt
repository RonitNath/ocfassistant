You can make this conversion using the following command: sudo singularity build my_image.simg ./my_sandboxed_container If you were working on the image on your own computer, you can transfer it over to your home directory on our infrastructure using the following command: scp my_image.simg my_ocf_username@hpcctl.ocf.berkeley.edu:~/ To actually submit a Slurm job that uses your Singularity container and runs your script my_executable.sh , run the following command: srun --gres = gpu --partition = ocf-hpc singularity exec --nv my_image.simg ./my_executable.sh This will submit a Slurm job to run your executable on the ocf-hpc Slurm partition.

The --gres=gpu option is what allows multiple users to run jobs on a single node so it is important to include. Without it, you will not be able to interface with the GPUs.
