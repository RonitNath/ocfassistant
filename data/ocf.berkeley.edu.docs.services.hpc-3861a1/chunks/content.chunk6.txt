If you are working on our infrastructure you will not be able to install non-pip packages on your container, because you do not have root privileges.

If you would like to create your own container with new packages, you must create the container on your own machine, using the above command with sudo prepended, and then transfer it over to our infrastructure.

The docker://ubuntu option notifies Singularity to bootstrap the container from the official Ubuntu docker container on Docker Hub .

There is also a Singularity Hub , from which you can directly pull Singularity images in a similar fashion. We also have some pre-built containers that you may use to avoid having to build your own. They are currently located at /home/containers on the Slurm master node.

Using Your Container singularity shell my_container The above command will allow you to shell into your container.
